The proteins in this system exhibit a diverse range of functions, but a significant number are involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation. This includes proteins that participate in the cellular response to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and other forms of cellular injury.

2. TP53, a well-known tumor suppressor, plays a pivotal role in the response to DNA damage and other cellular stresses. It can induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis depending on the context and extent of damage.

3. CASP2 (caspase-2) and BIK (Bcl-2-interacting killer) are pro-apoptotic proteins that contribute to the initiation and execution phases of apoptosis. CASP2 is involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BIK is a member of the Bcl-2 family that can induce apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

4. Proteins such as HSPA1A (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 1A) and GLUL (glutamate-ammonia ligase) are involved in the cellular stress response. HSPA1A acts as a molecular chaperone, helping to refold proteins and prevent aggregation under stress conditions, while GLUL is implicated in nitrogen metabolism and can be upregulated in response to metabolic stress.

5. Antioxidant enzymes like GPX3 (glutathione peroxidase 3) protect cells from oxidative damage by reducing peroxides, which can be a source of cellular stress.

6. Several proteins in this system, such as CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and FOSL1 (FOS-like antigen 1), are involved in cell cycle regulation and can influence the cellular response to stress by halting cell cycle progression to allow for repair or to initiate apoptosis.

7. The presence of proteins like ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) and MMP7 (matrix metallopeptidase 7) indicates a role in extracellular matrix remodeling, which can be associated with tissue repair following injury or stress.

8. TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) is a component of the innate immune system and can trigger inflammatory responses to cellular damage or the presence of pathogens.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into pathways that detect and respond to cellular stress and damage. They work in concert to regulate apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and control cell cycle progression in response to various stress signals. The system's prominent biological process is the coordination of cellular stress responses and the regulation of apoptosis, which is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the propagation of damaged cells."	0.85	regulation of multicellular organismal process	GO:0051239	0.0001152947250975	29	2955	72	1060P11.3,ADAM17,CCL18,CD58,CPT1A,CST3,CTNNB1,FTH1,HNRNPL,KLF4,MAFF,NUTF2,GUSBP14,TFF3,TLR4,TMEM176B,TNFAIP6,TP53,BTG3,CDKN2A,CYP1B1,GABRP,GPM6B,HEBP1,HSPA1A,MMP7,PLA2G4A,SERPINA5,TFPI2	0.009673115410273516	0.4027777777777778	TP53 CASP2 BIK HSPA1A GPX3 CDKN2A TLR4	7.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" because they are explicitly involved in pathways that detect and respond to cellular stress, regulate apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and control cell cycle progression.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.

2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.

3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.

4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.

5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.

6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.

7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses."	0.88	response to stimulus	GO:0050896	1.3776806645839302e-07	58	8976	72	1060P11.3,ACKR1,ATP6V1D,AXIN1,BCL6,BEX1,CCNG2,CHRDL1,DDIT4,DUSP4,ENAH,FABP4,NIBAN1,FASN,FLNA,FOXO3,G6PD,ADGRG6,ADGRG2,INSIG1,JUND,KDM4B,LPP,MT1X,MTA1,MYC,NAMPT,PHLDA1,PIP5K1B,PROM1,PRR7,RHOB,RND3,RRAGD,S100A14,SCD,SERPINA3,SERPINB2,SFRP1,STC2,TIPARP,TRIB3,TSC22D3,UGDH,C8ORF33,CCNE2,COL10A1,COL11A1,CPS1,DKK3,DNAJA1,EFNB2,HNRNPA0,HSPA1A,MAF,NID2,SESN1,SFPQ	0.0064516129032258064	0.8055555555555556	DDIT4 DNAJA1 HSPA1A ATF5 ASNS FASN G6PD SCD BCL6 FOXO3 MYC NFIL3 LDLR INSIG1	14.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation"" due to their definitive roles in cellular stress response mechanisms, metabolic processes, and gene expression control related to these functions.

Several proteins in this system, such as BNIP3L, BTG1, CDKN1B, DDIT4, and TXNIP, are involved in cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation. BNIP3L is known to play a role in inducing apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways, while BTG1 is implicated in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. CDKN1B (p27Kip1) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates cell cycle progression and can induce cell cycle arrest in response to stress. DDIT4 is a stress response protein that inhibits mTOR signaling, which is crucial for cell growth and survival. TXNIP interacts with thioredoxin, playing a role in oxidative stress response.

2. Proteins such as CD44, ERBB3, and METTL7A are associated with cell signaling and communication. CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. ERBB3 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family with roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. METTL7A, while less characterized, may be involved in lipid metabolism and is associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress.

3. Proteins like INSIG1, NRIP1, and UCP2 are involved in metabolic regulation. INSIG1 is a regulator of cholesterol synthesis, NRIP1 (RIP140) is a nuclear receptor co-repressor that regulates genes involved in energy homeostasis, and UCP2 is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial ROS production.

4. Several histone proteins, such as HIST1H2AC and HIST1H2BD, are present, indicating a potential role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. These proteins are part of the nucleosome core and are involved in the packaging of DNA into chromatin, affecting gene expression patterns.

5. Proteins like AQP3 and SLC2A2 are involved in transport functions. AQP3 is an aquaglyceroporin that facilitates the transport of water, glycerol, and other small solutes across cell membranes, which is important for cell volume regulation and skin hydration. SLC2A2 (GLUT2) is a glucose transporter with a role in glucose homeostasis.

6. GDF15, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. It is often upregulated in response to cellular stress and injury.

7. The presence of proteins such as CDK19, CDC25A, and CDK2AP1 suggests a role in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control. CDK19 is part of the mediator complex that is essential for transcriptional regulation, CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK2AP1 is an inhibitor of CDK2, regulating cell cycle progression.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex network of processes that respond to cellular stress and regulate apoptosis. They also play roles in cell signaling, metabolic regulation, chromatin remodeling, transport, and cell cycle control. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress conditions and to regulate cell fate decisions. The name ""Cellular Stress Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" reflects the prominent processes of stress response and apoptosis regulation, with a high proportion of the genes contributing to these functions."	0.85	regulation of programmed cell death	GO:0043067	0.0004357719889376	18	1506	65	BASP1,BNIP3L,CCNG2,CD44,CDK19,DNAJC12,GNA15,NRIP1,RAP1GAP,SELENOP,TNNT1,TSC22D3,TXNIP,ZMYND8,DLK1,DPYSL3,NT5DC2,PFKP	0.01159047005795235	0.27692307692307694	BNIP3L BTG1 CDKN1B DDIT4 TXNIP	5.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set ""Cellular Stress Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" is supported by several genes that are definitively involved in cellular stress responses, apoptosis regulation, and related processes.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying biological process, it is not possible to assign a specific name that accurately represents the collective activities of these proteins.

For instance, proteins such as MYB, NCOA2, and TFAP2C are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation, but they regulate different sets of genes and are involved in distinct biological processes. Similarly, proteins like ERBB2 and ERBB3 are receptor tyrosine kinases that play roles in cell signaling and growth, yet they do not define the overall function of the system.

Metabolic enzymes such as AKR1B10 and GSTA4 are involved in detoxification and redox balance, while proteins like HSPA1A and DNAJB1 are molecular chaperones that assist in protein folding and stress responses. Cell cycle regulators such as CCNE2 and CDC25A are crucial for cell division, but again, they do not represent a common process for the entire system.

These enzymes work sequentially to convert acetyl-CoA into cholesterol.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) is a regulatory protein that inhibits the proteolytic activation of SREBPs (sterol regulatory element-binding proteins), which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, including cholesterol. This indicates a feedback mechanism to maintain lipid homeostasis.

3. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the uptake of cholesterol from the blood, which is critical for maintaining cellular cholesterol levels and preventing hypercholesterolemia.

4. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. This process is essential for the creation of membrane phospholipids and the storage of triglycerides.

5. ACLY (ATP citrate lyase), ACSL1 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1), and FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) are involved in the synthesis and modification of fatty acids, which are crucial components of cellular membranes and signaling molecules.

6. LPIN1 (lipin 1) and ME1 (malic enzyme 1) are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and energy production. LPIN1 acts as a phosphatidate phosphatase, playing a role in triglyceride biosynthesis, while ME1 is involved in the conversion of malate to pyruvate, producing NADPH for biosynthetic processes.

Several proteins in this system are directly involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1) is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase) catalyzes the final step in cholesterol synthesis. FDFT1 (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1) is responsible for the first committed step in cholesterol production, the synthesis of squalene from farnesyl diphosphate.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) plays a regulatory role in cholesterol synthesis. It binds to sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and retains them in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing their processing and subsequent activation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the uptake of cholesterol from the bloodstream, providing feedback regulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis.

3. FASN (fatty acid synthase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of fatty acids, a process closely related to the production of cholesterol, as both pathways share precursors and regulatory mechanisms.

4. Several other proteins in the system, such as DDX17 (DEAD-box helicase 17) and KDELR3 (KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 3), may not be directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis but can influence the process indirectly through their roles in RNA processing and protein trafficking, respectively.

5. The presence of NOTCH2 (Notch homolog 2) suggests a link to cellular differentiation and proliferation, which could be related to the demand for cholesterol in membrane synthesis during cell growth.

6. The system also includes proteins with more diverse functions that do not directly relate to cholesterol metabolism, such as AGTR1 (angiotensin II receptor type 1) involved in blood pressure regulation, and BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like) which is implicated in apoptosis and autophagy.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, indicating a strong emphasis on cholesterol homeostasis. The interplay between enzymes of the biosynthesis pathway, regulatory proteins, and receptors ensures tight control of cholesterol levels within cells and throughout the body.

Several proteins in this system, such as ATF3, DDIT4, HMOX1, and NUPR1, are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. ATF3 is a transcription factor that is rapidly induced by various stress signals. DDIT4 is a modulator of the mTOR pathway, which is a key regulator of cell growth and stress response. HMOX1 encodes heme oxygenase 1, which is involved in the degradation of heme and has a protective role in oxidative stress. NUPR1 is a stress-induced protein that plays a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

2. Proteins like CCND2, ID4, IGFBP5, and PDGFRA are associated with cell cycle regulation and growth. CCND2 is a cyclin that drives cells through the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. ID4 acts as a regulator of cell growth by inhibiting differentiation and maintaining cells in a proliferative state. IGFBP5 is involved in the regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) activity, which is critical for cell growth and development. PDGFRA is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the platelet-derived growth factor family, and it plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.

3. The presence of histone proteins HIST1H1C, HIST1H2AC, and HIST1H2BD suggests involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, which are processes that can be linked to stress response and tumor suppression through the regulation of gene expression.

4. Tumor suppressive functions are also indicated by proteins such as ANXA1, which has anti-inflammatory properties and a potential role in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. SERPINA3 is a serine protease inhibitor that can influence apoptosis, and PROS1 (Protein S) is known to have anticoagulant and cytoprotective activities.

5. The system includes proteins like VEGFA, which is a major regulator of angiogenesis, and FN1, which encodes fibronectin, a glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and migration processes. These proteins are crucial in the context of tumor growth and metastasis.

6. Stress granule-associated proteins such as TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA1) and G3BP stress granule assembly factor 1 (G3BP1) are not explicitly listed, but their involvement in stress response pathways could be inferred through the presence of other stress-related proteins.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response mechanisms and tumor suppressive activities. They participate in the regulation of cell cycle, response to oxidative stress, chromatin remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation. The system reflects a multifaceted response to cellular stress that can contribute to the suppression of tumorigenesis."	0.85	response to stress	GO:0006950	2.7315394281197606e-06	39	3855	81	1060P11.3,ANXA1,ASNS,CCND2,CFD,CWC25,DDIT4,FCGBP,H2BC5,LASP1,LMO4,MARS1,NFIL3,NID2,OLFM4,PCGF2,PCK2,PROM1,PSMB3,SDC2,SGCE,TPD52,UBQLN2,UFM1,ATP6V0E2,BCL6,CYFIP2,ENPP2,GAL,GATA3,KRT5,LGALS3BP,P4HTM,PPIG,PRDX2,PXDN,SFN,SPRR1A,TFPI2	0.010007698229407237	0.48148148148148145	ATF3 DDIT4 HMOX1 NUPR1 CCND2 ID4 IGFBP5 PDGFRA HIST1H1C HIST1H2AC HIST1H2BD ANXA1 SERPINA3 PROS1 VEGFA FN1	16.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Tumor Suppression"" due to their involvement in cellular stress responses, cell cycle regulation, chromatin remodeling, and tumor suppressive activities.

Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1), DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase), SQLE (squalene epoxidase), LSS (lanosterol synthase), and CYP51A1 (cytochrome P450 family 51 subfamily A member 1), are key enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. These enzymes work sequentially to convert acetyl-CoA into cholesterol, a fundamental component of cell membranes and precursor for steroid hormones.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are involved in the regulation of cholesterol levels. INSIG1 is a crucial mediator in the feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, while LDLR is responsible for the uptake of cholesterol into cells via endocytosis of LDL particles.

3. ACSL3 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3) and SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) are involved in fatty acid metabolism. ACSL3 activates long-chain fatty acids for both synthesis of cellular lipids and degradation via beta-oxidation. SCD is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids.

4. FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) is another enzyme involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are essential components of cell membranes and precursors to signaling molecules.

6. INSR (insulin receptor) and IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) are key components of the insulin signaling pathway, which has significant effects on lipid metabolism by influencing the activity of enzymes such as lipases and lipoprotein lipase.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and metabolism of cholesterol and lipids. They contribute to the maintenance of cellular membrane integrity, production of steroid hormones, and regulation of lipid levels in the body. The interplay between these proteins ensures proper lipid homeostasis, which is critical for overall cellular function and energy balance."	0.85	multicellular organismal process	GO:0032501	3.1903217765780034e-05	49	7669	71	1060P11.3,COQ8A,AGR2,ALDH3A2,ATF3,BASP1,BTG2,CFD,CFLAR,CTNND1,CYP51A1,DDIT4,DHCR24,DPYSL2,FBXL12,IGFBP4,INSIG1,INSR,IRS2,KRT19,LDLR,LSS,NEU1,NRCAM,PKIG,SATB2,SCD,SFN,SLC12A2,SLC2A6,SLN,TLE2,TNNT1,TPSB2,ZBED2,BEX1,CLDN18,FASTKD5,FOSB,GJA1,KCTD12,LRRC17,MMP9,OLFML2A,PDGFC,RNF167,SELENOP,SERPINA1,STX1A	0.006371083084124301	0.6901408450704225	HMGCS1 DHCR24 SQLE LSS CYP51A1 INSIG1 LDLR	7.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the given name ""Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Lipid Metabolism Regulation"" as they are directly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and metabolism of cholesterol and lipids.

MST1R, also known as the Macrophage Stimulating 1 Receptor or RON tyrosine kinase receptor, is primarily involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as growth, survival, and differentiation. It is activated by its ligand, Macrophage Stimulating Protein (MSP), and is implicated in wound healing, immune responses, and potentially in the invasive growth of cancer cells. MST1R signaling can lead to the activation of various pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, and the JAK/STAT pathway, which are critical for cell proliferation and survival.

2. PRPF31 is a component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA. It is involved in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing, which is a crucial process for the generation of mature, translatable mRNA molecules. Mutations in PRPF31 are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, indicating its importance in the maintenance of retinal cell function.

3. SUB1, also known as PC4, is a multifunctional protein that has roles in transcriptional coactivation, DNA repair, and the regulation of transcriptional elongation. It binds to single-stranded DNA and interacts with RNA polymerase II, influencing the transcription of specific genes. SUB1 is also implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage and is involved in maintaining genome stability.

To summarize, the proteins MST1R, PRPF31, and SUB1 are involved in distinct biological processes: MST1R in cell signaling and growth regulation, PRPF31 in mRNA processing, and SUB1 in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair.

However, zinc finger proteins are a large family with diverse functions and target genes, making it difficult to assign a single biological process to this group without additional context.

Other proteins in the list, such as SLC39A6 and SLC39A10, are members of the solute carrier family and are involved in metal ion transport. Their functions are critical for cellular metal homeostasis but are not directly related to the functions of zinc finger proteins.

Proteins like EPM2AIP1, TBC1D19, and TPGS1 have roles in various cellular processes including mRNA processing, intracellular trafficking, and protein transport, respectively. These functions, while essential to cellular operation, do not suggest a common biological process shared with the other proteins in the list.

TTC23, TTLL1, and MYSM1 are involved in processes such as tubulin modification, histone demethylation, and gene expression regulation. Again, these are important cellular functions but do not align under a single biological process with the other proteins mentioned.

NICN1, PGBD1, and LRRC49, along with the zinc finger proteins ZKSCAN1, ZKSCAN8, ZSCAN1, and ZSCAN21, are involved in various aspects of nucleic acid binding and regulation, but they do not appear to converge on a specific, shared biological pathway based on the information provided.

1. Several proteins like SLC39A5 and SLC5A12 are transporters, indicating roles in ion and nutrient transport, but they do not suggest a unified process.

2. Signal transduction is represented by proteins such as EPHB1 and IRS1, which are involved in different signaling pathways and do not point to a single, cohesive biological process.

3. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like HEY2 and MEIS2, but they regulate diverse sets of genes and are involved in various developmental and cellular processes.

The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.

2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.

3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.

4. Proteins such as SLC34A1, SLC15A3, and SLC23A2 are transporters that facilitate the movement of specific substrates across cellular membranes. SLC34A1 is a phosphate transporter, SLC15A3 is a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, and SLC23A2 is a vitamin C transporter.

5. The presence of proteins like IDH3A, LDHB, and GYS1 indicates involvement in metabolic processes. IDH3A is a subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase involved in the TCA cycle, LDHB is involved in lactate metabolism, and GYS1 is glycogen synthase, which plays a role in glycogen biosynthesis.

6. Proteins such as OPTN, CEACAM1, and PLAUR are implicated in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions. OPTN is involved in autophagy and NF-κB signaling, CEACAM1 participates in cell adhesion and signaling, and PLAUR (uPAR) is involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling.

To summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.

Given the complexity and diversity of the protein functions, the confidence score is not at the maximum, as not all proteins are directly involved in the identified processes. However, the prominence of the innate immune response and apoptosis regulation components justifies a relatively high confidence score."	0.85	response to stress	GO:0006950	7.207538037741957e-05	35	3855	79	ADAMTS18,ZNF71,LOC283745,NMUR2,ADGRF1,BRIP1,LRRC40,STAT2,SAMD9L,IFIH1,RTP4,ISG20,CD274,ZBP1,APOL6,IL4I1,OPTN,PLAUR,WHAMM,RHBDF2,IRF1-AS1,PHF11,CXCL11,LGALS9,NUB1,RP2,ADPRH,PPP4R1L,MPC1,MECOM,IPO11,OSBP2,RAB26,APMAP,RAP1GAP	0.008976660682226212	0.4430379746835443	IFIH1 STAT2 IRF1 TLR3 CD274 ISG20 IFIT2 CXCL11 CASP10 BCL2L11 RELA	11.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Innate Immune Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" due to the presence of multiple genes with definite roles in these processes.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, protein processing, cellular metabolism, and immune responses. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Signal Transduction: Proteins like MAP3K7, GPR110, and TNFRSF11A are involved in different signaling pathways. MAP3K7 is a kinase that plays a role in the NF-kappaB pathway, while GPR110 is a G protein-coupled receptor, and TNFRSF11A is a receptor for TNFSF11/RANKL and is important for osteoclastogenesis.

2. Gene Regulation: Transcription factors like FOXP1 and KLF5 are involved in regulating gene expression. FOXP1 is implicated in the development of several tissues, including the heart and lung, while KLF5 plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.

3. Protein Processing and Trafficking: SEC61B is part of the protein translocation apparatus in the endoplasmic reticulum, and KDELR2 is involved in the retrieval of ER-resident proteins. Proteins like CUL4A and UBE4B are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for protein degradation.

4. Metabolism: Enzymes like GDA (guanine deaminase) and GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase) are involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, respectively.

5. Immune Response: HLA-DRB1 is an MHC class II cell surface receptor important for the immune system to recognize foreign molecules.

6. RNA Processing: Proteins like SRRM1 and DDX54 are involved in RNA splicing and remodeling, which are critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

7. Cell Cycle and Division: NEK2 is a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, and STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division.

8. Apoptosis and Cell Survival: MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, while TNFSF10 (TRAIL) is a cytokine that induces apoptosis.

9. Structural Components: TPM1 is a tropomyosin protein that plays a role in the structure and function of the cytoskeleton.

Several proteins in this system, such as MCM8, RPA1, and POLR3D, are involved in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. MCM8 is part of the minichromosome maintenance complex necessary for the initiation of DNA replication. RPA1 is involved in DNA replication and repair, while POLR3D is a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which synthesizes small RNAs and is involved in cell growth and maintenance.

2. Proteins like NFKB2, PPP1R15A, and HES1 are key components in stress response and signaling pathways. NFKB2 is part of the NF-kappa-B family of transcription factors that play a crucial role in inflammation and immune responses. PPP1R15A, also known as GADD34, is involved in the stress-induced regulation of protein synthesis. HES1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is implicated in cell differentiation and proliferation.

3. Proteins such as RAC1, CCT3, and RNF115 are involved in cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking, and protein ubiquitination, respectively. RAC1 is a small GTPase that regulates the formation of actin cytoskeleton. CCT3 is a chaperonin involved in the proper folding of actin and tubulin. RNF115 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of proteins, targeting them for degradation.

4. Proteins like CDV3, CBR3-AS1, and MET are involved in various cellular processes. CDV3 is associated with vesicle-mediated transport, CBR3-AS1 is a non-coding RNA that may regulate gene expression, and MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, motility, and differentiation.

5. Several ribosomal proteins, including RPS6P6, RPL14, RPL34, and RPL31, are present, indicating a role in protein synthesis. These proteins are components of the ribosome and are essential for the translation of mRNA into proteins.

6. Proteins like LPAR3 and FLCN are involved in cell signaling and nutrient sensing. LPAR3 is a G-protein coupled receptor for lysophosphatidic acid, which mediates cell proliferation and survival. FLCN is a tumor suppressor that may be involved in energy and nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, with a significant number participating in cell proliferation, DNA replication, stress response, and protein synthesis. The interplay between these proteins suggests a complex network that regulates cell growth and responds to cellular stress. The presence of ribosomal proteins and factors involved in DNA replication and repair indicates a system geared towards supporting cell division and handling cellular stress."	0.85	cellular nitrogen compound biosynthetic process	GO:0044271	0.0400737529983996	29	4836	63	FLCN,ZNF79,CCT3,BAALC,PARP12,PPP1R15A,NFKB2,RIOK3,CEBPG,POLR3D,CDV3,CBR3-AS1,DEDD,CAPN3,CDYL,CSRNP2,ZBTB43,CCDC91,ZNF280D,ELOVL5,METTL15,PFDN5,TMEM33,CTNND1,WWOX,PRMT2,CCDC93,CHFR,CASP9	0.00595482546201232	0.4603174603174603	MCM8 RPA1 POLR3D NFKB2 PPP1R15A HES1 RPS6P6 RPL14 RPL34 RPL31	10.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Proliferation and Stress Response"" due to their involvement in key processes such as DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, stress response, and protein synthesis.

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:

1. Several proteins such as TSPEAR, SST (somatostatin), PAX6, and METTL3 are involved in distinct cellular processes. For example, TSPEAR is associated with Notch signaling and development, SST is a hormone that inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones, PAX6 is a key regulatory gene in eye and neural development, and METTL3 is involved in mRNA methylation, impacting RNA stability and translation.

2. Proteins like SETMAR, ZMIZ1, and SMAD7 are implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, respectively. These proteins play roles in maintaining genomic integrity, regulating gene expression, and modulating cell signaling pathways.

3. Proteins such as GNG3 (a G protein subunit), KIF2C (a kinesin involved in mitosis), and STK3 (a serine/threonine kinase) are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and apoptosis, which are fundamental cellular processes but not indicative of a unified biological process within this system.

4. Transport and trafficking proteins like SLC19A2 (a thiamine transporter), MAGOH (involved in mRNA splicing and export), and ABCA6 (a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family) highlight the diversity of functions related to cellular transport mechanisms present in this system.

5. Proteins such as FERMT1 and ACTR6 are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, respectively, which are critical for cellular structure and motility but do not suggest a common biological process for the system.

6. The presence of non-coding RNA genes like MORC2-AS1 and THAP7-AS1 indicates regulatory roles at the RNA level, adding another layer of functional diversity to the system.

7. The inclusion of proteins with poorly characterized functions or those represented by locus names (e.g., LOC100131929, C1ORF213) further complicates the identification of a unified biological process.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in a multitude of cellular functions, including development, hormone signaling, gene expression regulation, RNA processing, transport, cell signaling, and structural integrity. The diversity and lack of a clear, overarching biological process performed by the majority of these proteins necessitate the designation of this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00."	0.0	chromatin organization	GO:0006325	0.0292916851627292	7	816	26	SETMAR,RLIM,PAX6,THAP7-AS1,METTL3,CASTOR3P,ACTR6	0.008383233532934131	0.2692307692307692											False	True

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and molecular functions, including but not limited to:

1. Structural components (e.g., KRT80, a keratin involved in the structural integrity of epithelial cells).
2. Transcription factors and gene regulation (e.g., POU2F2, which plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in the immune system and development).
3. Enzymatic activity in metabolic pathways (e.g., ALDH1B1, an aldehyde dehydrogenase involved in retinoic acid biosynthesis).
4. Signal transduction (e.g., NFKBIA, an inhibitor of the NF-kappa-B pathway).
5. Transport proteins (e.g., SLC22A15, a solute carrier family protein).
6. Cell cycle and division (e.g., ANAPC10, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex).
7. DNA and RNA processing (e.g., DDX19A, a DEAD-box RNA helicase involved in mRNA export from the nucleus).

Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying theme or pathway that they are all significantly involved in, it is not possible to assign a specific biological process that is prominently performed by this system. The proteins listed participate in a multitude of processes that are essential for various cellular functions, but they do not collectively represent a coherent system dedicated to a single biological process.

Therefore, the most accurate description for this set of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the broad spectrum of unrelated functions they serve within the cell.
