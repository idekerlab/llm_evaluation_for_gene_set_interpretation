Therefore, the process name is assigned as ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating the lowest confidence level."	0.0	System of unrelated proteins	The provided proteins, MORC3, ZNF627, and EHMT1, do not exhibit a prominent biological process when analyzed together. They are involved in diverse cellular functions, with no apparent functional integration or interplay. MORC3 is associated with microtubule organization and cell migration, ZNF627 is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, and EHMT1 functions in histone methylation and gene silencing. Therefore, assigning a specific biological process name to this system would be misleading and inaccurate. The confidence score of 0.00 reflects the lack of evidence supporting a unified biological process for these proteins.	0.0
