2. TLR4, or Toll-like receptor 4, is a critical component of the innate immune system. It recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria and initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLR4 signaling is essential for the immediate host defense against bacterial infections and plays a role in the development of systemic inflammation.

They are involved in the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to creatine, forming phosphocreatine and ADP. This reaction is crucial for buffering and storing high-energy phosphate groups in tissues with fluctuating energy demands, such as muscle and brain.

2. CKM (Creatine Kinase, Muscle) and CKB (Creatine Kinase, Brain) are cytosolic isoforms of creatine kinase. CKM is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue, while CKB is found mainly in the brain. These isoforms facilitate the same reaction as the mitochondrial creatine kinases, but within the cytosol, contributing to the energy homeostasis in their respective tissues.

3. The interaction between mitochondrial and cytosolic creatine kinases is essential for the creatine phosphate shuttle. This system transports high-energy phosphate from mitochondria to sites of energy consumption within the cell. Phosphocreatine generated by mitochondrial creatine kinases can be transported to the cytosol, where it serves as an immediate reserve of high-energy phosphates to rapidly regenerate ATP from ADP during periods of increased energy demand.

4. The creatine kinase system plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, especially in tissues that have high and variable energy requirements. It ensures a constant supply of ATP, which is critical for numerous cellular processes, including muscle contraction, ion transport, and cellular signaling.

In summary, the proteins in this system work in concert to form an efficient energy buffering and transfer network, which is vital for rapid energy supply and overall energy homeostasis in energetically demanding tissues. The creatine kinase system exemplifies a highly integrated process where the function of each protein is closely related to and dependent on the others, reflecting a high degree of functional interconnectivity and synergy."	0.98	High Confidence	0.50481653	53	0.9955622540400234	cellular response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxine	0.39400834	741	0.9379552876161767	futile creatine cycle|creatine transmembrane transport|creatine metabolic process	0.74902534|0.71677715|0.69386554

ABCG5 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 5) and ABCG8 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 8) are half-transporters that heterodimerize to form a functional transporter complex. This complex is primarily expressed in the liver and intestines, where it plays a crucial role in the excretion of dietary cholesterol and plant sterols from the body.

The system is characterized by a high degree of functional integration, with multiple proteins contributing to similar pathways and processes, which justifies the high confidence score."	0.92	High Confidence	0.19814226	9919	0.1694716570375952	ventricular cardiac muscle cell development	0.41562676	1607	0.8654441932512769	regulation of developmental process|regulation of multicellular organismal development|regulation of cell differentiation	0.88116753|0.80350655|0.8011528
