GO:2000524	LILRB2 LILRB4 CD160	3	negative regulation of T cell costimulation	LILRB4 RIPK1 RASSF2	ATOH7 DRAM1 TOGARAM2	Immune Response Modulation	"1. LILRB2 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor B2) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of various immune cells, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and subsets of T and B cells. It recognizes MHC class I molecules on target cells and transmits inhibitory signals that can modulate immune responses, particularly by inhibiting the activation and function of these cells.

2. LILRB4 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor B4), also known as ILT3, is another inhibitory receptor found on myeloid cells such as monocytes and dendritic cells. Similar to LILRB2, it interacts with MHC class I molecules and plays a role in the negative regulation of immune cell activation. LILRB4 engagement can lead to the induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and may contribute to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance.

3. CD160 is a cell surface molecule with a role in immune regulation, expressed on activated NK cells, T cell subsets, and endothelial cells. It can bind to classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules and deliver a co-stimulatory signal in NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, enhancing their activity. However, when CD160 is engaged on T cells, it can also deliver inhibitory signals, depending on the context and the presence of other co-receptors.

The proteins in this system are all involved in the modulation of immune responses through their interactions with MHC class I molecules. LILRB2 and LILRB4 primarily transmit inhibitory signals that can dampen immune cell activation, contributing to immune tolerance and preventing overactivation that could lead to autoimmunity. CD160 has a dual role, acting as a co-stimulatory molecule in some contexts while also capable of inhibiting T cell responses in others. The interplay between these proteins is crucial for balancing immune activation and maintaining self-tolerance, preventing inappropriate immune responses while still allowing for effective defense against pathogens."	0.92	Regulation of Inflammatory Signaling Pathways	"1. LILRB4 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor B4) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of myeloid cells. It is known to modulate immune responses, including the inhibition of cell activation signals. LILRB4 engagement can lead to the suppression of inflammatory responses, which is crucial in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing overactive immune reactions that could result in tissue damage.

2. RIPK1 (Receptor-Interacting Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase 1) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell death and inflammation. It is a key adaptor protein in several signaling pathways, including those initiated by TNF receptor, which can lead to NF-κB activation, apoptosis, or necroptosis depending on the cellular context. RIPK1's kinase activity is instrumental in dictating the cell's fate in response to stress and inflammatory signals.

3. RASSF2 (Ras Association Domain Family Member 2) is a tumor suppressor that is involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. It can interact with microtubules and has been implicated in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is important for controlling organ size and suppressing tumorigenesis. RASSF2 also potentially links to the regulation of inflammatory responses through its interactions with other signaling molecules.

The proteins in this system are involved in the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. LILRB4 acts as a negative regulator, potentially dampening inflammatory signals to prevent excessive immune activation. RIPK1 is a critical mediator that can either promote inflammation through NF-κB activation or induce cell death, serving as a switch between survival and death pathways. RASSF2, while primarily associated with tumor suppression, may influence inflammatory signaling indirectly through its impact on cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. The interplay between these proteins suggests a complex regulatory network that balances immune activation and cell death, which is essential for proper immune function and avoiding pathological inflammation.

Given the roles of these proteins, the most prominent biological process they perform appears to be the regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways. However, since RASSF2's direct involvement in inflammation is less clear compared to LILRB4 and RIPK1, the confidence score is not at the maximum."	0.75	System of unrelated proteins	"1.

The proteins listed above do not share a common biological process but rather participate in distinct and unrelated cellular functions. ATOH7 is specific to neuronal development in the retina, DRAM1 is involved in autophagy and cell death pathways, and TOGARAM2 is associated with microtubule modification in cilia and flagella. There is no evidence of a shared pathway or a synergistic or antagonistic interaction among these proteins that would suggest a unified biological process. Therefore, the most appropriate designation for this set of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating no confidence in a shared biological process."	0.0

The proteins in this system are all involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications. MORC3 and EHMT1, in particular, have direct roles in modifying the chromatin structure, while ZNF627 is likely to contribute to the regulation of specific target genes through its DNA-binding capacity. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated mechanism for the regulation of gene expression, where chromatin structure is altered to either permit or restrict access to transcriptional machinery, thereby influencing the transcriptional output of the cell. The presence of both chromatin remodeling and histone modifying activities in this system underscores its potential importance in the dynamic regulation of gene expression in response to various cellular signals or during different stages of cell development and differentiation."	0.85
