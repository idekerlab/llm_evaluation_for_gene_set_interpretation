The proteins listed here have diverse functions, making it challenging to identify a prominent biological process for the system as a whole. While some proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (NSMCE2, NSMCE1, SLF1, SLF2, ZNF493), others participate in protein synthesis (NARS1) or metabolism (TANGO2). Additionally, some proteins have more specific functions, such as EID3's role in transcriptional co-repression and PPP1R12A's involvement in PP1 regulation. The presence of OR11H4, an olfactory receptor with unknown function in humans, further complicates the identification of a unifying process for this system.

Given these observations, it is difficult to assign a single, prominent biological process to this system of interacting proteins.

This score reflects the limited functional coherence among the genes in this set and the absence of a clear, unifying biological process."	0.45	 Unclear biological process	"The provided list of proteins consists of various types, including olfactory receptors (OR5T1), transcription factors (SIX2, ZNF670), transporters (SLC10A3), vesicle transport-related proteins (VPS50, KIF13B), cell adhesion molecules (LRRN1), ribosomal proteins (RPS12), ciliary proteins (RSPH6A), and others.

While some of these proteins may be involved in specific processes, there is no clear dominant biological process that connects all the proteins in this system.

Other regulatory proteins: FLCN, FBXL15, ARK2C, MYOCD, PARP1, HFE, DAB2, SDCBP, NUP93, KCP, CREBBP, TGFB1, CRB2, HSP90AB1, TGFB1I1, TGFB2, KIAA0319, SLC2A10, ING2, BMP5, ADISSP, and TSC22D1 are regulatory proteins that participate in various cellular processes such as DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and protein degradation.

In summary, the primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of developmental processes and cell growth. These proteins work together to control gene expression, cell signaling, extracellular matrix organization, and various regulatory functions that ultimately shape tissue morphogenesis and organ development."	0.92	 Regulation of developmental processes and cell growth	"The system of interacting proteins consists of several transcription factors, signaling molecules, and regulatory proteins that are involved in the regulation of developmental processes and cell growth. These proteins can be grouped into several functional categories, including:

1. Transcription factors: CDH5, GATA4, GATA6, MSX1, MSX2, NUP93, RBPJ, ZNF143, ZNF423, ZNF514
2. Signaling molecules: BMP4, BMP6, BMPER, GDF2, GDF6, GDF7, TGFB2, TGFB3, FGF9, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, JAK2
3. Regulatory proteins: SH2B1, TSC22D1, CITED1, CITED2, EP300, SMAD2, ARK2C, CDKN1C, SNW1, NGEF, KIF12, CFL1, DUSP7, RNF170, PA2G4, ACAD9, ANXA7, KCNMB2, PSEN2, SYNRG

The transcription factors in this system play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression during development and differentiation. For example, GATA4 and GATA6 are involved in the development of the heart and gut, while MSX1 and MSX2 are involved in the development of the nervous system. RBPJ is a key component of the Notch signaling pathway, which is involved in cell fate determination and differentiation.

The signaling molecules in this system are involved in various signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and survival. For example, BMP4, BMP6, and BMPER are members of the TGF-β superfamily, which are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. GDF2, GDF6, and GDF7 are also members of the TGF-β superfamily and are involved in the regulation of bone development and homeostasis.

The regulatory proteins in this system are involved in various regulatory processes, such as signal transduction, protein modification, and gene expression. For example, SH2B1 is an adaptor protein that regulates insulin signaling and lipid metabolism. TSC22D1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune response. CITED1 and CITED2 are transcriptional coactivators that regulate the activity of other transcription factors. EP300 is a histone acetyltransferase that regulates gene expression by modifying chromatin structure.

In summary, the system of interacting proteins consists of several transcription factors, signaling molecules, and regulatory proteins that are involved in the regulation of developmental processes and cell growth. The majority of the genes in this system contribute to these processes, and therefore, the most prominent biological process performed by the system is the regulation of developmental processes and cell growth (0.85)."	0.85	 Regulation of gene expression and chromatin organization	"The proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin organization, with several transcription factors, co-factors, and chromatin modifiers present.

1. POU5F1, also known as OCT4, is a key transcription factor involved in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. It forms a complex with SOX2 and NANOG to regulate the expression of genes required for maintaining the undifferentiated state of these cells.

2. EED, RBBP5, and CARHSP1 are components of the COMPASS-like complex, which is involved in histone methylation and plays a crucial role in transcriptional activation and repression.

3. CBX4, a chromobox protein, is part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that mediates gene silencing through histone modification.

4. ZNF family proteins, such as ZNF213, ZNF44, ZNF48, ZNF737, ZNF749, and ZSCAN12, are transcription factors involved in various developmental processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

5. KLRC4-KLRK1 (also known as NKG2E-NKG2C) is a heterodimeric receptor expressed on natural killer cells that plays a role in immune surveillance and regulation of inflammation.

6. SMC1A, a subunit of the cohesin complex, is involved in sister chromatid cohesion during cell division and has been implicated in gene regulation through long-range chromosomal interactions.

7. RAB1A, RAB2A, and TBC1D32 are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that regulate intracellular vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics, which can indirectly influence gene expression by controlling the localization and activity of transcription factors.

8. ATOH7, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is involved in the development of the retina and inner ear and has been implicated in neurogenesis and cell fate determination.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins primarily functions in regulating gene expression and chromatin organization through various mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation, histone modification, and long-range chromosomal interactions. The presence of immune-related proteins such as KLRC4-KLRK1 suggests a potential role for this system in modulating inflammation and immune responses."	0.92	0.1890548	10223	0.1440174160596165	mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport	0.17600086	10687	0.10516620614585948	regulation of developmental growth|regulation of cell development|regulation of developmental process	0.87201786|0.8621056|0.82689005
