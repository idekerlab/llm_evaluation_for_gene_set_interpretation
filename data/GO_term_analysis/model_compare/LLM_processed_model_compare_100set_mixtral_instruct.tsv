4. ZNF family proteins, such as ZNF213, ZNF44, ZNF48, ZNF737, ZNF749, and ZSCAN12, are transcription factors involved in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and stress response.

5. KLRC4-KLRK1, LILRB1, and NECAP2 are immune receptors that play a role in regulating immune responses and inflammation.

6. RAB1A, RAB2A, and TBC1D32 are members of the RAS oncogene family, which regulates intracellular vesicle trafficking and signal transduction pathways.

7. ATOH7, OSER1, and SAPCD2 are transcription factors involved in cell fate determination and differentiation during development.

8. DCAF8, CYSLTR2, and FBXL7 are components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a role in protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes.

9. COLGALT1, TMCO1, and PRM2 are involved in protein synthesis, folding, and modification.

In summary, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in regulating gene expression and chromatin organization through various mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation, histone modification, and protein degradation. These processes play a crucial role in cell fate determination, differentiation, and overall cellular homeostasis."	0.92	High Confidence	High Confidence	High Confidence
