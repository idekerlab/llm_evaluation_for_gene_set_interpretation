GO:0005851	EIF2B2 EIF2B4 EIF2B3 EIF2B1 EIF2B5	5	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B complex	Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Regulation	"1. EIF2B2, EIF2B4, EIF2B3, EIF2B1, and EIF2B5 are all subunits of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). eIF2B is essential for protein synthesis as it recycles eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP, a necessary step for the initiation of translation.

2. The eIF2 complex, consisting of eIF2α, eIF2β, and eIF2γ subunits, binds to GTP and the initiator methionyl-tRNA to form a ternary complex. This complex is required to start translation by delivering the initiator tRNA to the ribosome. After the methionyl-tRNA is placed at the start codon, GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, and eIF2-GDP is released. The eIF2-GDP must be exchanged back to eIF2-GTP to participate in another round of translation initiation, a process catalyzed by eIF2B.

3. The activity of eIF2B is regulated by phosphorylation of the eIF2α subunit. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by kinases such as PKR, PERK, GCN2, and HRI in response to various stress signals leads to the inhibition of eIF2B. This results in a general decrease in translation initiation, allowing the cell to conserve resources under stress conditions. However, certain critical proteins, such as those involved in stress response, can still be translated due to the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their mRNAs.

4. The coordinated action of the eIF2B subunits is crucial for the control of protein synthesis and cellular response to environmental conditions. Mutations in any of the eIF2B subunits can lead to diseases such as leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), highlighting the importance of eIF2B in neural cell function and maintenance.

In conclusion, the eIF2B complex, composed of EIF2B2, EIF2B4, EIF2B3, EIF2B1, and EIF2B5, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of translation initiation. It is a key player in the cellular response to stress and is essential for the proper control of protein synthesis.

GO:0070721	STAT2 STAT1 IRF9	3	ISGF3 complex	Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3 (ISGF3) Signaling Pathway	"1. STAT1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1) is a member of the STAT protein family that becomes phosphorylated in response to cytokines and growth factors. It forms a heterodimer with STAT2 in response to interferon (IFN) signaling, particularly type I IFNs. This phosphorylation event is critical for the activation of STAT1 and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription activator.

2. STAT2 is another member of the STAT family and operates in a similar manner to STAT1. It is essential for the type I IFN signaling pathway. Upon activation, STAT2 forms a heterodimer with STAT1, and this complex is a key component of the ISGF3 transcription factor complex.

3. IRF9 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 9) is a transcriptional regulator that plays a central role in type I interferon signaling. It associates with the STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer to form the ISGF3 complex, which translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).

The proteins STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 interact to form the ISGF3 complex, which is a critical component of the type I interferon signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for the cellular antiviral response, as it leads to the expression of ISGs that help to inhibit viral replication and modulate the immune response. The formation of the ISGF3 complex and its translocation to the nucleus represents a key step in the transcriptional activation of these genes. Given that all three proteins are directly involved in the formation and function of the ISGF3 complex, the name ""Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3 (ISGF3) Signaling Pathway"" accurately reflects the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins."	0.95	0.82806104	1	0.9994036970781156	eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex	0.29272705	871	0.4806201550387596	ISGF3 complex|CHOP-ATF3 complex|CHOP-ATF4 complex	0.82806104|0.5278869|0.5203506
GO:0035189	E2F1 RB1 E2F2 TFDP1	4	Rb-E2F complex	Cell Cycle Regulation and Progression	"1. E2F1 and E2F2 are members of the E2F family of transcription factors, which play a crucial role in controlling the cell cycle by regulating the expression of genes required for DNA replication and cell cycle progression. E2F1 is known for its role in the activation of S-phase promoting genes and can also induce apoptosis under certain conditions. E2F2, while similar in function, has a more restricted set of target genes and is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly the G1/S transition.

2. RB1, or retinoblastoma protein, is a key regulator of the cell cycle that functions by inhibiting the E2F family of transcription factors. When RB1 is phosphorylated, it releases E2F transcription factors, allowing them to activate genes necessary for S-phase entry. RB1 thus acts as a tumor suppressor by preventing excessive cell proliferation.

3. TFDP1, also known as DP1, forms heterodimers with E2F transcription factors, enhancing their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. The E2F/DP1 complex is essential for the proper regulation of the cell cycle and for the timely expression of genes involved in DNA synthesis and repair.

The interplay between these proteins is central to the control of the cell cycle. RB1's interaction with E2F1 and E2F2 forms a regulatory hub that ensures cells only proceed to DNA replication when appropriate. The E2F/DP1 complex fine-tunes this control by providing additional regulation of target gene expression. The balance and regulation of these interactions are critical for normal cell cycle progression and the prevention of uncontrolled cell growth, which can lead to oncogenesis.

In summary, the proteins in this system work together to regulate the progression of the cell cycle, particularly the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase, and are integral to maintaining cellular proliferation in check. The system's components are tightly interconnected, with RB1 acting as a gatekeeper that, upon phosphorylation, allows E2F1 and E2F2 to drive the cell cycle forward, while TFDP1 modulates the activity of E2F transcription factors."	0.95	0.36106557	165	0.9016100178890876	U2 snRNP	0.2096727	1557	0.071556350626118	cell division site|cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex|cytoplasmic cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex	0.5861646|0.52858293|0.50572336
