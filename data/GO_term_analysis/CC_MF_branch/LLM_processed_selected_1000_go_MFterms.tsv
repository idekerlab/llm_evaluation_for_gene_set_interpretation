1. The SLC1, SLC6, and SLC38 subfamilies include transporters that primarily mediate the uptake of neurotransmitters and amino acids into cells. For example, SLC1A2 (EAAT2) is a glutamate transporter involved in the reuptake of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, which is crucial for terminating the synaptic transmission and preventing excitotoxicity. SLC6A1 (GAT1) is a GABA transporter, which reuptakes GABA from the synaptic cleft and modulates inhibitory neurotransmission.

2. The SLC5 and SLC23 subfamilies are involved in the transport of vitamins and simple carbohydrates. SLC5A6 (SMVT) is a sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter that facilitates the uptake of biotin, pantothenate, and lipoate. SLC23A1 and SLC23A2 are sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters involved in ascorbic acid uptake.

3. The SLC10 subfamily includes sodium-dependent bile acid transporters, such as SLC10A1 (NTCP), which is essential for the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, a process critical for dietary fat digestion and cholesterol homeostasis.

4. The SLC13 subfamily consists of sodium-dependent dicarboxylate and sulfate transporters, such as SLC13A5, which is involved in citrate transport, and SLC13A2, which mediates the uptake of sulfate, an important substrate for sulfation reactions.

5. The SLC38 subfamily includes sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporters, such as SLC38A1 (SNAT1), which are involved in the cellular uptake of amino acids for protein synthesis and metabolism.

The commonality among these proteins is their role in the transport of various molecules across cell membranes, which is essential for maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis. The proteins work in a coordinated manner to ensure that cells have access to necessary nutrients and can effectively remove metabolic waste products. The transport processes mediated by these proteins are also critical for the function of specific tissues, such as the brain, liver, and intestine, where precise regulation of substrate availability is required for normal physiological function.

Given the diversity of substrates transported by the SLC family members, the most prominent biological process performed by this system is the regulation of transport across cellular membranes. The SLC transporters are functionally integrated within the system, with each transporter contributing to the overall homeostasis of the cell and organism by mediating the uptake or efflux of specific substrates.

GO:0046703	RAET1E MICB ULBP3 HLA-E RAET1G MICA ULBP2 ULBP1	8	natural killer cell lectin-like receptor binding	Immune Surveillance and Natural Killer Cell Modulation	"1. RAET1E, RAET1G, MICA, MICB, ULBP1, ULBP2, and ULBP3 are all ligands for the NKG2D receptor, which is found on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, as well as some T cells. These ligands are stress-induced and are typically upregulated in response to cellular stress, infection, or transformation. Their interaction with NKG2D leads to the activation of NK cells, resulting in the targeted killing of the stressed or transformed cells.

2. HLA-E is a non-classical MHC class I molecule that presents a limited repertoire of peptides derived from the leader sequences of other MHC class I molecules. It interacts with the inhibitory receptor NKG2A/CD94 on NK cells and some T cells, sending an inhibitory signal to these cells. This interaction plays a crucial role in preventing the destruction of healthy cells by the immune system, contributing to immune tolerance.

The proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of immune surveillance by modulating the activity of NK cells. The balance between activating signals from NKG2D ligands (RAET1E, RAET1G, MICA, MICB, ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3) and inhibitory signals from HLA-E ensures that only cells exhibiting signs of stress or abnormality are targeted for destruction, while normal cells are protected. This system is critical for the detection and elimination of potentially dangerous cells, such as those infected by viruses or undergoing malignant transformation, and for maintaining self-tolerance. The high confidence score reflects the clear and specific role these proteins play in immune surveillance and the modulation of NK cell activity."	0.95

Similar to C5a, C3a is involved in the inflammatory response, promoting chemotaxis, and increasing vascular permeability. C3AR1 is expressed on various cell types, including immune cells and plays a role in the immune response by activating leukocytes and triggering degranulation.

The proteins in this system are all receptors involved in the complement system, which is a crucial part of the innate immune response. They mediate various cellular responses to complement activation, which include inflammation, chemotaxis of immune cells, and enhancement of phagocytosis. The interplay between these receptors is essential for the modulation of the immune response to ensure that it is effective in defense against pathogens while also being regulated to prevent excessive tissue damage. The presence of both activating (C5AR1, C3AR1) and potentially regulatory (C5AR2) receptors in this system highlights the balance between amplification and control within the complement-mediated immune response."	0.95
