The Wnt signaling pathway is represented by proteins such as WNT3A, WNT5A, WNT1, WNT10B, LRP3, and AXIN1. These proteins are crucial for various cellular processes including cell fate determination, proliferation, and migration. WNT3A, WNT5A, WNT1, and WNT10B are ligands that activate the pathway, while LRP3 is a potential co-receptor, and AXIN1 is a negative regulator of the pathway. The presence of multiple Wnt ligands and regulators suggests a significant role for Wnt signaling in this system.

2. Cellular stress response elements are indicated by proteins such as DDIT3, also known as CHOP, which is a transcription factor activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress, and SIRT1 and SIRT2, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases involved in the response to oxidative stress and aging. TGFB1 and SMAD3 are part of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, which is known to be involved in cellular stress responses, including the response to inflammation and tissue damage.

3. Proteins like FOXO1, E2F1, and BMAL1 are transcription factors that play roles in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and circadian rhythm, respectively. Their presence indicates a regulatory network that controls cell proliferation, survival, and metabolic rhythms.

4. The system also includes proteins involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis, such as INSIG1, which helps regulate cholesterol synthesis, and SORT1, which is involved in lipoprotein metabolism.

5. Proteins like IL6 and TNF are cytokines that mediate inflammatory responses, suggesting a role in immune signaling and inflammation within this system.

6. The presence of multiple Wnt signaling molecules, along with proteins involved in stress responses, lipid metabolism, and inflammation, suggests a complex interplay between these pathways. The system likely regulates cellular responses to developmental cues, stress, and metabolic changes.

To summarize, the system of interacting proteins appears to be primarily involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling and cellular stress responses. These processes are interconnected, with Wnt signaling influencing cell fate and proliferation, and stress response proteins modulating cellular survival and adaptation to environmental changes. The confidence score reflects the prominence of Wnt and stress response proteins in the system, although not all proteins are directly linked to these processes, hence the score is not a full 1.00."	0.85	Medium Confidence	0.12548663	11554	0.0325713807251109	pyrimidine ribonucleoside monophosphate biosynthetic process	0.18906754	9841	0.1760026793937871	regulation of cellular response to stress|regulation of Wnt signaling pathway|regulation of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway	0.7262345|0.7084471|0.6966753	0.00013166826369465795|1.0206922127068983e-11|0.08215830978612922	0.0002424038513729637|3.837188769574805e-11|0.13103398689972762	1.0	1.0	0.013062409288824383|0.036011080332409975|0.012658227848101266	0.0	18	0.3461538461538461
GO:1904339	WNT3A GSK3B SHH	3	negative regulation of dopaminergic neuron differentiation	Canonical Wnt and Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Integration	"1. WNT3A is a member of the WNT protein family that signals through the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. It plays a crucial role in embryonic development, cell fate determination, and organogenesis. WNT3A binds to the Frizzled family of receptors and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP5/6), leading to the inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex, which includes GSK3B. This results in the stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus where it activates Wnt target gene transcription.

2. GSK3B (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta) is a serine/threonine kinase that is a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK3B phosphorylates β-catenin, marking it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. GSK3B is also involved in various other cellular processes, including insulin signaling and neuronal function, but its role in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is highly significant for cell proliferation and differentiation.

3. SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) is a secreted protein that is fundamental for the patterning of the embryonic ectoderm. It binds to the Patched-1 (PTCH1) receptor, relieving the inhibition on Smoothened (SMO), a G protein-coupled receptor-like protein. This activation leads to the translocation of GLI transcription factors into the nucleus and the transcription of Hedgehog target genes. SHH signaling is critical for the development of many tissues and organs and is also implicated in the regulation of stem cell populations.

The proteins WNT3A, GSK3B, and SHH are central to two major signaling pathways: the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the Hedgehog signaling pathway. These pathways are known to interact with each other, with cross-talk occurring at various levels, including the regulation of GSK3B activity and GLI transcription factors. The integration of these pathways is essential for the precise regulation of developmental processes and tissue homeostasis. The proteins in this system are not only involved in their respective individual pathways but also in the coordination and integration of signaling events that are critical for proper cellular communication and response.

Given the involvement of all three proteins in these highly interconnected and overlapping pathways, the name ""Canonical Wnt and Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Integration"" is proposed with a high confidence score, reflecting the significant roles these proteins play in these combined biological processes."	0.92	High Confidence	0.09919368	11662	0.0235284266934605	regulation of intracellular mRNA localization	0.27148482	6919	0.420664824583438	canonical Wnt signaling pathway|smoothened signaling pathway involved in dorsal/ventral neural tube patterning|Wnt signaling pathway	0.67585087|0.64332056|0.6393231	5.5845001895334345e-06|1.0|1.7507850439351638e-05	1.178164596947982e-05|1.0|4.489192420346574e-05	1.0	1.0	0.009900990099009901|0.0|0.006772009029345372	0.0	3	1.0
