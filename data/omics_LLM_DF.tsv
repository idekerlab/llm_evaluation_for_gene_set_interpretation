11. HFE2, also known as HJV, is a co-receptor for the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of hepcidin, a key hormone in iron homeostasis.

12. TFR1 (encoded by TFRC) is the transferrin receptor, which mediates cellular iron uptake by endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the processes of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. They contribute to the development and maintenance of red blood cells, hemoglobin synthesis, and the regulation of iron homeostasis, which are critical for oxygen transport and overall cellular function. The majority of the genes listed play a direct or regulatory role in these processes, justifying the high confidence score."	0.92

ACKR3, also known as CXCR7, is a receptor for chemokines involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cell migration. It is also implicated in the modulation of inflammatory responses.

2. ADM (Adrenomedullin) functions as a vasodilator and is involved in the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure, as well as having anti-inflammatory effects.

3. ADORA2B is an adenosine receptor that plays a role in inflammatory and immune responses by inhibiting neutrophil degranulation and superoxide generation.

4. The AK family, including AK4, is involved in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism, particularly in the context of stress response and adaptation to changes in energy demand.

5. AKAP12 is a scaffolding protein that coordinates the assembly of multiprotein complexes and is involved in signal transduction pathways, including those regulating cell growth and cytoskeletal organization.

6. The ALDO family, including ALDOA, ALDOB, and ALDOC, are key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, converting fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
