The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities, including but not limited to metabolism, signal transduction, gene expression regulation, and structural integrity. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Metabolic enzymes such as ABAT, ASS1, and DLD are involved in amino acid metabolism and the citric acid cycle, respectively. These enzymes are crucial for energy production and nitrogen balance.

2. Proteins like CHI3L1 and GAL are associated with inflammation and neurotransmission, indicating roles in immune response and nervous system function.

3. Transport and structural proteins such as CLDN3, CAV1, and CAV2 are involved in maintaining cellular barriers and modulating signal transduction pathways.

4. Transcription and translation regulatory proteins like ATF1, EIF4A1, and POLR2K are key components in gene expression and protein synthesis.

5. Signal transduction molecules such as PIK3R1 and PTGER4 play roles in various signaling pathways, including those related to cell growth and immune response.

7. INHBB (Inhibin Beta B) is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily and is involved in the regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone secretion and has roles in reproductive physiology.[7][8][9]

8. LYPD1 (LY6/PLAUR Domain Containing 1) is a protein with less well-defined functions but is thought to be involved in cell adhesion and signaling.[10][11][12]

9. NUP93 is a component of the nuclear pore complex and is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a fundamental process in cellular function.[13][14][15]

10. SOX9 is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in chondrogenesis and the development of various tissues, including the testis and central nervous system.[16][17][18]

11. AKAP12 (A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 12) is involved in the regulation of signal transduction and is implicated in the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion.[19][20][21]

12. ALCAM (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule) is involved in cell adhesion and signaling in the immune system and in neural development.[22][23][24]

13. CDH3 (Cadherin 3) is a classical cadherin involved in cell-cell adhesion and is important in the establishment of epithelial cell polarity.[25][26][27]

14. CTSH (Cathepsin H) is a lysosomal enzyme that plays a role in protein degradation and processing within the lysosome.[28][29][30]

15. GDF15 (Growth Differentiation Factor 15) is involved in the regulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways and has been implicated in various diseases.[31][32][33]

16. SUMO2 (Small Ubiquitin-Like Modifier 2) is involved in post-translational modification of proteins and plays a role in a variety of cellular processes, including nuclear-cytosolic transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and protein stability.[34][35][36]

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a unifying biological process, these proteins do not form a coherent system with a single identifiable function. Therefore, the most appropriate name for this set of proteins is ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in a single, prominent biological process performed by this system.

ATF3, Activating Transcription Factor 3, is a stress-responsive transcription factor that is rapidly induced by a variety of stress signals. It plays a role in the cellular response to stressors such as DNA damage and oxidative stress, and can either promote or suppress apoptosis depending on the context.

2. CASP1, Caspase 1, is an enzyme that plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. It is part of the inflammatory response and is involved in the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Its activity is a key aspect of the innate immune system and inflammation-related apoptosis.

3. ADM, Adrenomedullin, is a peptide involved in the regulation of physiological processes including vasodilation and angiogenesis. It also has anti-apoptotic effects and can be upregulated in response to hypoxia and oxidative stress.

4. CRIM1, Cysteine Rich Transmembrane BMP Regulator 1, is involved in cellular growth and differentiation, particularly in the context of vascular and kidney development. It may also play a role in cellular response to stress, although its functions are less well characterized.

5. DKK3, Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 3, is implicated in the modulation of WNT signaling, which is important for cell fate determination, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is considered a tumor suppressor and is involved in cellular stress responses.

6. MECOM, MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus, is a transcription regulator involved in hematopoiesis and may play a role in apoptosis and cell proliferation. It is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.

7. PIK3R1, Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 1, is part of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is critical for cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. It is often implicated in the cellular response to growth factors and stress.

8. S100A8, a member of the S100 family of proteins, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immune response. It can also be associated with stress responses in cells.

9. SST, Somatostatin, is a hormone that inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones and has a role in cell proliferation. It can act as a paracrine signaling molecule that modulates stress and apoptosis in neighboring cells.

10. TNC, Tenascin C, is an extracellular matrix protein that modulates cell signaling and can influence cell survival, apoptosis, and response to stress, particularly in the context of tissue injury and repair.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of the cellular stress response and the regulation of apoptosis. They include transcription factors, enzymes, signaling molecules, and structural proteins that respond to stress signals, mediate cell survival or death decisions, and regulate inflammation. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to cellular stress, with implications for apoptosis, survival, and inflammation."	0.85	0	2/9	0.0001254825432606	0.0598551731353354	TNC;FOLR1	Axon Regeneration (GO:0031103)	Axon Regeneration 	GO:0031103	GAP43 RTN4RL1 RTN4RL2 TNC NREP MTR MAPK8IP3 FOLR1 DHFR	0.30670327	0.0444444444444444	True	False	"1.

The proteins in this system exhibit a diverse range of functions, but a significant number are involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation. This includes proteins that participate in the cellular response to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and other forms of cellular injury.

2. TP53, a well-known tumor suppressor, plays a pivotal role in the response to DNA damage and other cellular stresses. It can induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis depending on the context and extent of damage.

3. CASP2 (caspase-2) and BIK (Bcl-2-interacting killer) are pro-apoptotic proteins that contribute to the initiation and execution phases of apoptosis. CASP2 is involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BIK is a member of the Bcl-2 family that can induce apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

4. Proteins such as HSPA1A (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 1A) and GLUL (glutamate-ammonia ligase) are involved in the cellular stress response. HSPA1A acts as a molecular chaperone, helping to refold proteins and prevent aggregation under stress conditions, while GLUL is implicated in nitrogen metabolism and can be upregulated in response to metabolic stress.

5. Antioxidant enzymes like GPX3 (glutathione peroxidase 3) protect cells from oxidative damage by reducing peroxides, which can be a source of cellular stress.

6. Several proteins in this system, such as CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and FOSL1 (FOS-like antigen 1), are involved in cell cycle regulation and can influence the cellular response to stress by halting cell cycle progression to allow for repair or to initiate apoptosis.

7. The presence of proteins like ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) and MMP7 (matrix metallopeptidase 7) indicates a role in extracellular matrix remodeling, which can be associated with tissue repair following injury or stress.

8. TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) is a component of the innate immune system and can trigger inflammatory responses to cellular damage or the presence of pathogens.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into pathways that detect and respond to cellular stress and damage. They work in concert to regulate apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and control cell cycle progression in response to various stress signals. The system's prominent biological process is the coordination of cellular stress responses and the regulation of apoptosis, which is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the propagation of damaged cells."	0.85	0	4/46	2.7833278264925705e-05	0.01120217517602	FTH1;S100A6;CTNNB1;TP53	Regulation Of Fibroblast Proliferation (GO:0048145)	Regulation Of Fibroblast Proliferation 	GO:0048145	CD74 PDGFRA CD300A PLA2G2C WNT5A SPHK1 MED9 FN1 IGF1 LIG4 PEX2 EREG DAB2IP SKI PARP10 CDK6 CDK4 NDUFS4 NF1 S100A6 B4GALT7 TRIM32 GAS6 TP53 DDR2 DHX9 PLA2G1B CDKN1A CTNNB1 GSTP1 PDGFC PDGFB PDGFA BMI1 CDC73 NLRC3 SFRP1 AQP1 E2F1 FTH1 MYC EMD AMH WNT1 WNT2 MORC3	0.38467973	0.0338983050847457	True	False	"1.

5. The immunoglobulin proteins (IGHM, IGJ, IGKV1-5, IGKV4-1, IGL, IGLJ3, IGLV2-23) are components of the adaptive immune system, with roles in antigen recognition and response.[13][14][15]

6. FBLN1 and FBN1 are involved in the structure and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). FBLN1 participates in cell adhesion and migration, while FBN1 is a large ECM glycoprotein that plays a role in the integrity of connective tissue.[16][17][18]

7. VEGFA is a key regulator of angiogenesis, which is essential for wound healing and response to tissue ischemia, processes that are often associated with inflammation and immune responses.[19][20][21]

8. ACTN1 and ITGA4 are involved in cell adhesion and migration, which are important for immune cell trafficking and extravasation into inflamed tissues.[22][23]

9. Proteins such as PDGFRA and TGFBI are involved in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, which are processes that can be linked to tissue repair and fibrosis, often following immune responses.[24][25][26]

10. The presence of proteins like SFTPA2 and SFTPB indicates a role in lung-specific immune defense mechanisms, as these proteins are involved in the innate immune system of the respiratory tract.[27][28][29]

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of the immune response, including antigen presentation, chemotaxis, opsonization, and the adaptive immune system. Additionally, several proteins contribute to the organization and function of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for tissue integrity and repair following immune-mediated damage. The interplay between these proteins suggests a system that is primarily engaged in coordinating immune responses and maintaining structural integrity of tissues.

Therefore, the most appropriate designation for the biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the lack of a unifying biological process among the proteins listed. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in naming a specific biological process for this diverse group of proteins.

Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1), FDFT1 (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1), DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase), DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase), MSMO1 (methylsterol monooxygenase 1), SC5D (sterol-C5-desaturase), and SQLE (squalene epoxidase), are directly involved in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that control the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. LDLR is responsible for the removal of cholesterol from the bloodstream via endocytosis of lipoprotein particles.

3. ACLY (ATP citrate lyase) is an enzyme that converts citrate to acetyl-CoA, a precursor for both the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. ELOVL5 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5) and FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) are involved in the elongation and desaturation of fatty acids, respectively, which are critical steps in the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

4. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. SLC27A2 (solute carrier family 27 member 2) is involved in the uptake and activation of long-chain fatty acids.

5. Proteins such as IDI1 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1) and FDFT1 are involved in the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are important for various cellular functions including the prenylation of proteins.

6. The presence of several cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1B1 (cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1) and CYP51A1 (cytochrome P450 family 51 subfamily A member 1) indicates roles in drug metabolism and the synthesis of sterols, respectively.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of cholesterol and lipids. They participate in the mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and desaturation, and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.

2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.

3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.

4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.

5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.

6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.

7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses."	0.88	8	3/24	9.306144097509942e-05	0.008811066159447	DUSP5;MYC;ZFP36L1	ERK1 And ERK2 Cascade (GO:0070371)	ERK1 And ERK2 Cascade 	GO:0070371	DUSP5 DUSP6 EGF MAP2K2 MAP2K1 KARS1 PTGER4 ZFP36L1 IGF1 MT3 HTR2B DUSP9 DUSP7 ZFP36L2 MYC FGF10 CDK1 KDR AVP CTSH MAPK1 SOX9 ITGAV LGALS9	0.44540966	0.031578947368421	True	False	"1. Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.[1][2][3]

2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.[4][5][6]

3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.[7][8][9]

4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.[10][11][12]

5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.[13][14][15]

6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.[16][17][18]

7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.[19][20][21]

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses.

CHEK1 (Checkpoint kinase 1) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that, in response to DNA damage, coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. It is a key player in the cellular stress response to damaged DNA and is involved in preventing the replication of damaged DNA by activating cell cycle checkpoints.

2. PDCD4 (Programmed cell death protein 4) is a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits neoplastic transformation and translation by binding to eIF4A, playing a role in apoptosis and cell survival.

3. ZFP36L2 (Zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 2) is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. It binds to adenine-uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs and promotes their degradation, thus playing a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level during stress responses.

4. S100A10 (S100 calcium-binding protein A10) is implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. It is also known to play a role in the stress response, particularly in the context of inflammation.

5. ADRB2 (Beta-2 adrenergic receptor) is involved in the response to adrenaline and noradrenaline in various tissues. Activation of this receptor leads to a cascade of events involved in the fight-or-flight response and can also modulate the immune response and apoptosis.

6. AKR1B1 (Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B) is part of the polyol pathway and is involved in the detoxification of aldehydes and ketones, which are products of oxidative stress.

7. OAS1 (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1) is an interferon-induced protein that plays a role in the antiviral response and can induce apoptosis in cells that are infected with a virus.

8. SULF1 (Sulfatase 1) modulates the sulfation state of proteoglycans and is implicated in cellular response to growth factors and in the regulation of cell signaling in response to cellular stress.

9. Other proteins in the list, such as DAB2, EGLN3, MFAP5, MXRA5, PLEKHM1, PTPRE, SLC38A1, SPTSSA, CHGB, CRISP3, CYBA, ENC1, HLA-DMB, HOMER2, NME4, RARRES1, SORD, STX1A, and UGCG, are involved in various cellular processes including signal transduction, metabolism, vesicle trafficking, immune response, and membrane transport. While they may not directly relate to a single cohesive process, their functions can intersect with cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in a range of processes, but a significant number of them play roles in the cellular response to stress and the regulation of apoptosis. These proteins interact in complex ways to maintain cellular integrity and respond to damage, with implications for cell survival, cell cycle control, and programmed cell death. The confidence score reflects the fact that while many proteins in the system contribute to these processes, not all are directly involved, and the system represents a network with diverse functions."	0.85	0	2/6	2.623727537628245e-05	0.0141943659785688	MFAP5;ZFP36L2	Definitive Hemopoiesis (GO:0060216)	Definitive Hemopoiesis 	GO:0060216	MFAP5 LYL1 TEK HIPK1 TGFBR3 ZFP36L2	0.23434742	0.064516129032258	True	False	"1.

Several proteins in this system, such as CD44, VCAN (Versican), and CHI3L1 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1), are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. VCAN is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in tissue remodeling and is often upregulated in various cancers.

2. Proteins like EXT1 (Exostosin-1) and XYLT1 (Xylosyltransferase 1) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, respectively. These activities are crucial for the structure and function of the ECM, which is a key component of the tumor microenvironment.

3. The presence of proteins such as TNFRSF21 (Death receptor 6) and TNFSF10 (TRAIL) indicates involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways. These proteins can modulate cell death and survival, which are critical processes in cancer progression and response to therapy.

4. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family of proteins that are involved in regulating cell fate and patterning during development. In the context of cancer, WNT5A has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.

5. The system includes immune-related proteins such as IGHM, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20, and IGL, which are components of immunoglobulins. These suggest a role in immune surveillance or response within the tumor microenvironment.

6. Proteins like TGFBR2 (Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II) and S100A6 are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGFBR2 is a key mediator of TGF-beta signaling, which has complex roles in tumor progression, including tumor suppression in early stages and promotion of invasion and metastasis in later stages.

7. The presence of XIST, a long non-coding RNA involved in X chromosome inactivation, suggests a potential role in epigenetic regulation within the system, although its specific role in this context is less clear.

In summary, the proteins in this system are collectively involved in the dynamic modulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly through ECM remodeling, cell adhesion, migration, immune response, and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival.

CD40 and CD58 are cell surface proteins that play critical roles in immune response modulation. CD40 is a costimulatory protein found on antigen-presenting cells and is required for their activation. It interacts with CD40LG on T cells, leading to a variety of immune and inflammatory responses. CD58, also known as LFA-3, is involved in the adhesion of T cells to antigen-presenting cells, enhancing the immune synapse formation and T cell activation.

2. FGL2, also known as fibrinogen-like protein 2, has prothrombinase activity and is implicated in the regulation of thrombosis and inflammation. It is also involved in the suppression of T cell proliferation and the induction of regulatory T cells, contributing to immune regulation.

3. IGJ (Immunoglobulin J chain) and IGLV2-23 (Immunoglobulin Lambda Variable 2-23) are components of the immune system. IGJ is involved in the polymerization of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), which are crucial for mucosal immunity. IGLV2-23 is part of the variable region of the immunoglobulin light chain, playing a role in antigen recognition.

4. JUN is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, which is involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is also implicated in the response to stress and plays a role in immune and inflammatory responses.

5. RGS1 (Regulator of G-protein Signaling 1) modulates signaling through G-protein coupled receptors, which are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including immune response. RGS1 can regulate the migration of B cells and is involved in immune homeostasis.

6. SRC is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell division, survival, and migration. In the immune system, SRC kinases are critical for T cell receptor signaling and other receptor-mediated signaling pathways.

7. YTHDF1 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1) is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, processes that are crucial for the rapid protein synthesis required during immune responses.

8. Other proteins such as AZGP1, GOLM1, LXN, MBNL1, PRAME, SRGN, TFF1, CYP4B1, FAR2, FCGBP, FLRT3, GRN, IFI27, and SLC39A8 have various functions ranging from metabolism, cell adhesion, RNA binding, to protein folding. While they may not directly interact with the immune system, their roles could indirectly affect immune cell function or be involved in pathways that intersect with immune signaling.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the regulation of immune responses, with a focus on cell signaling, antigen presentation, and the modulation of immune cell activity. The system reflects a complex interplay between proteins that directly participate in immune cell function and those that indirectly influence immune responses through various cellular processes."	0.85	0	2/22	0.0003412344556437	0.0689624736522089	JUN;SLC39A8	Cellular Response To Cadmium Ion (GO:0071276)	Cellular Response To Cadmium Ion 	GO:0071276	DAXX JUN CHUK SLC11A1 FOS MT1X MMP9 EGFR MAPK9 MT1A MAPK8 HSF1 SUMO1 AKT1 MAPK3 MT1G MT1H MAPK1 NCF1 SLC39A8 MT1E MT1F	0.43555796	0.0444444444444444	True	False	"1.

Several proteins in this system, such as BNIP3L, BTG1, CDKN1B, DDIT4, and TXNIP, are involved in cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation. BNIP3L is known to play a role in inducing apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways, while BTG1 is implicated in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. CDKN1B (p27Kip1) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates cell cycle progression and can induce cell cycle arrest in response to stress. DDIT4 is a stress response protein that inhibits mTOR signaling, which is crucial for cell growth and survival. TXNIP interacts with thioredoxin, playing a role in oxidative stress response.

2. Proteins such as CD44, ERBB3, and METTL7A are associated with cell signaling and communication. CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. ERBB3 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family with roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. METTL7A, while less characterized, may be involved in lipid metabolism and is associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress.

3. Proteins like INSIG1, NRIP1, and UCP2 are involved in metabolic regulation. INSIG1 is a regulator of cholesterol synthesis, NRIP1 (RIP140) is a nuclear receptor co-repressor that regulates genes involved in energy homeostasis, and UCP2 is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial ROS production.

4. Several histone proteins, such as HIST1H2AC and HIST1H2BD, are present, indicating a potential role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. These proteins are part of the nucleosome core and are involved in the packaging of DNA into chromatin, affecting gene expression patterns.

5. Proteins like AQP3 and SLC2A2 are involved in transport functions. AQP3 is an aquaglyceroporin that facilitates the transport of water, glycerol, and other small solutes across cell membranes, which is important for cell volume regulation and skin hydration. SLC2A2 (GLUT2) is a glucose transporter with a role in glucose homeostasis.

6. GDF15, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. It is often upregulated in response to cellular stress and injury.

7. The presence of proteins such as CDK19, CDC25A, and CDK2AP1 suggests a role in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control. CDK19 is part of the mediator complex that is essential for transcriptional regulation, CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK2AP1 is an inhibitor of CDK2, regulating cell cycle progression.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex network of processes that respond to cellular stress and regulate apoptosis. They also play roles in cell signaling, metabolic regulation, chromatin remodeling, transport, and cell cycle control. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress conditions and to regulate cell fate decisions. The name ""Cellular Stress Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" reflects the prominent processes of stress response and apoptosis regulation, with a high proportion of the genes contributing to these functions."	0.85	0	9/537	0.0001763712862331	0.0628480884637707	RNF167;IFITM1;BTG1;CDKN1B;ERBB3;RB1CC1;TXNIP;PRAME;FOXO4	Negative Regulation Of Cellular Process (GO:0048523)	Negative Regulation Of Cellular Process 	GO:0048523	BTBD18 ATG13 GTPBP4 SPINT2 MYL2 AGTR2 CDK10 HSPA1A CDA HSPA1B TES ADAMDEC1 RB1 RNF2 HPGD NAIF1 ADARB1 CLDN3 DLL1 TOB2 TOB1 DLL4 IFNL1 GNG4 SPOCK3 ALOX5 MYC CYP1B1 ZNF268 S100A11 KLF11 GPLD1 ST18 TSPYL2 GML INCA1 ACTL6A ACTL6B KLF10 VPS13C TEX19 THAP12 SULT2B1 VAMP8 NOX4 ST20 PPT1 STRN CRYAB DELEC1 VAMP3 ATF5 CRYAA RRP8 PHB1 CTBP2 CTBP1 ENO1 TMEM98 GATA3 GJA1 NUP62 SOX17 NKX3-1 MYBL1 ZBTB7C HOXC9 BARD1 GSDME SS18 FGFBP1 LYN CCL23 DUSP1 SPHK2 ANXA6 MYOG TESC WNT9A CDC6 SIRT1 DCBLD2 KAT2B SINHCAF RAPGEF2 PHF14 CDKN3 CRLF3 GAS8 BTG4 BTG3 BTG2 BTG1 CTCF PRDM11 SHH ATG101 CDKN2C CDKN2D DYNLL1 CDKN2A CDKN2B NR1H3 NR1H2 ADAM10 LDOC1 DHRS2 DAB2IP FABP3 COL4A3 FABP6 ADAM15 FABP7 LPCAT3 INHA CDKN1B TP53I13 CDKN1A NDUFA13 RARG TGFB1I1 ADAM22 ING1 HOXD10 ING5 ING4 RNF139 TP53TG5 GPNMB AGR3 AGR2 BRD9 PRAME RACK1 TP53I11 JAK2 PTPN2 CD164 BICRAL PLXNC1 ZBTB17 SEMA4D MUL1 CHERP FOXP3 RNF41 SKI CNOT7 WT1 ST7L PDCD5 PLXNB3 PLXNB2 GMNC PLXNB1 COPS8 PTPN6 KANK2 SEMA5A PLXND1 CLU PARK7 FOXO4 FRZB SH3BP4 NACC2 RBBP4 ADORA3 JAM2 RBBP7 SH2B3 AICDA MINAR1 F2R GLMN IGFBP6 WFS1 MAP2K1 IGFBP3 SLC9A3R1 HOPX FRMD5 RGCC MDM4 ZNF777 PIN1 RNF167 NOTCH4 NOTCH1 BLM ATP8A2 GMNN TACSTD2 STK11 SESN2 PIM2 PLXNA3 TNFRSF8 PLXNA2 PLXNA1 IGFBP7 MEN1 PLXNA4 ITGA1 ANGPT1 AVPR2 EIF2AK2 OSGIN2 EIF2AK3 NRG1 OSGIN1 FUZ PTPN14 DUX4L1 TNFRSF21 CDK6 BCL6 APOA1 SCGB3A1 NF2 BMPR2 CELF1 VPS4A BMP10 VPS4B ADRA1D CDC73 TREM2 SAV1 KNG1 DNAJB2 SPN MDK CCDC85B ZNF503 DRD2 EMILIN1 IP6K2 MAGI2 MYO16 SMARCC1 TBX1 NTRK1 TP53INP1 NGF TBX5 MYO1C PPM1D DNAJA3 INSM1 TXNIP CRK CBLL1 CEBPA SMARCD1 PIWIL2 PPP1R13B PIWIL4 FHL1 ZBTB49 PTEN PLG ZNRF4 ADAMTS1 WDR6 VPS35 EPHB2 DIS3L2 PIWIL1 ADAMTS8 NCK2 P3H3 P3H2 PPP2R1A SMARCA2 EREG P3H1 RUNX3 SMARCA4 PML SFRP4 SFRP5 SFRP2 SST APC AZGP1 NEURL1 PRKRA ULK1 EPHA4 TP53 CD200 APP EI24 IFITM1 CDKN2AIP SFRP1 CCAR2 ACTB TIAL1 CCN6 CCN5 CCN4 CCN3 CCN2 E2F7 FKTN CER1 GPR15LG APOBEC3D APOBEC3F APOBEC3G APOBEC3H GDF2 PLAAT4 TENT5B CBFA2T3 TENT5C ALOX15B WNK2 CSNK2B ASTL APOBEC3A APOBEC3B APOBEC3C PLPP1 VGLL4 ANP32B IFI35 WFDC1 DCUN1D3 TXNDC12 IFIT3 SOX4 CYP27B1 MCIDAS FTH1 TP53BP2 SOX7 TNS2 CDT1 IL10 NLRP2B LILRB1 NME6 CTTNBP2NL NME1 RHOB IL1A BST2 IL1B TFAP4 DCSTAMP CLDN19 EEF1E1 COL18A1 PTPRU TENM1 ACVRL1 SUV39H1 BRCA1 PTPRK UMOD PTPRJ HNF4A SMYD2 CD33 NPM1 SUZ12 CGREF1 PACRG DEFB118 PBRM1 SUSD2 PROX1 PODN PPP2CA SLURP1 SIPA1 AKR1B1 CTNNB1 MIA3 WAS MALSU1 NUDT6 HYAL1 SERTAD2 HYAL2 SERTAD3 ENPP1 HRAS ENPP7 TFAP2B TGFB1 TGFB3 TGFB2 APLP2 OSM TSC2 TSC1 CGRRF1 POU4F2 NUPR1 TGFBI CHMP4C CHMP4A NUPR2 RAF1 TFAP2A RIPOR2 CIB1 FBLN1 NDRG3 LMNA TBRG1 PDPN TMEM127 SLIT2 SLIT1 MSX1 DSCAM NIBAN2 SMAD3 SMAD4 H2AC8 H2AC6 INHBA TDRD9 ESR2 SMAD6 HGS DLG3 TMEM115 DLG5 CAPRIN2 DDAH1 CDH13 CHMP2B CHMP3 CHMP2A CHMP7 CHMP5 CHMP6 SIRPG CCDC125 HTRA2 JADE1 ETS1 PDS5B PPP1R9B NR4A1 BRINP1 BRINP3 BRINP2 PODXL CHMP1B NPPB CHMP1A TMEM109 UTP20 ADGRG1 ARID2 RFPL1 MYOCD AXIN2 PPP2R5C IFNLR1 MT3 OPRM1 HMGA1 BMP7 WNT16 BMP5 BMP4 IRF1 RASA1 BMP2 IL6 TMIGD3 MMRN2 ITGB1BP1 MYH9 PDE3B NDUFS3 IRF6 IFNK FBP1 BNIPL CXCL8 RTN4 DDX3X CCL3L1 NPR1 PINX1 CXCL1 SCIN WNT11 BCL7B ERBB4 BCL7A BCL7C ERBB3 GPER1 DACT3 LPXN DACT2 POU1F1 NOS3 WARS1 SOD2 THAP5 PTHLH PSRC1 REST ADGRB1 ALDH1A2 TAF6 ZP4 ZP3 RERG AQP11 RB1CC1 THBS1 ARHGDIG ACVR1B PKD2 BICRA RND1 FLCN RBM5 TCHP CLMN RPS6KA2 PTK2B SPEG VHL GET1	0.35535884	0.0149253731343283	True	False	"1.

Several proteins in this system, including AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C3, are part of the aldo-keto reductase family. These enzymes are involved in the detoxification of aldehydes and ketones, reduction of steroid hormones, and are implicated in resistance to oxidative stress. They play a role in the metabolism of prostaglandins and are linked to the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation.

2. ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, and ALDH3A1 are members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family, which are key enzymes in the metabolism of aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids, contributing to the cellular response against oxidative stress. These enzymes are also involved in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid, a critical regulator of gene expression during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis.

3. GCLM is a modifier subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione, which is a major antioxidant that protects cells from toxins and oxidative stress.

4. HMOX1 encodes heme oxygenase 1, an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron. It is a stress-response protein induced by oxidative stress and plays a protective role in the antioxidant defense.

5. ME1 encodes malic enzyme 1, which is involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle that is crucial for NADPH production, a cofactor for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant defense.

6. PLA2G2A encodes a phospholipase A2, which hydrolyzes the sn-2 position of phospholipids, releasing arachidonic acid, a precursor for the synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. This enzyme is involved in the initiation of the inflammatory response and regulation of lipid metabolism.

7. PPAP2B encodes phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2B, which is involved in lipid signaling and metabolism, particularly in the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, a precursor for the synthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids.

8. RHOBTB3 is involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and may play a role in the cellular stress response by regulating the Golgi apparatus.

9. UCHL1 encodes ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1, which is involved in the processing of ubiquitin precursors and ubiquitinated proteins. This protein is important for the maintenance of protein turnover and cellular stress responses.

10. AMIGO2 and 1060P11.3 are less characterized in the context of this system, but AMIGO2 is known to be involved in cell adhesion and may play a role in signal transduction pathways.

11. ADIRF, also known as ADRP or ADFP, is involved in the regulation of lipid droplets and adipocyte differentiation, and it may play a role in lipid homeostasis and storage.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and the metabolism of lipids. They function in the detoxification of harmful substances, the synthesis of antioxidants, the regulation of inflammatory responses, and the maintenance of lipid homeostasis. The system reflects a coordinated response to oxidative stress and the management of lipid metabolism, with implications for cellular protection and homeostasis."	0.85	1	3/16	2.3372249917408985e-07	1.425707244961948e-05	AKR1C1;AKR1C3;AKR1C2	Prostanoid Metabolic Process (GO:0006692)	Prostanoid Metabolic Process 	GO:0006692	CES1 GSTM1 HPGD AKR1C2 AKR1C1 GSTP1 AKR1C4 AKR1C3 CYP4F8 PTGR2 PTGR1 HPGDS CYP2S1 GSTA1 PLAA PTGES	0.47492462	0.1034482758620689	True	False	"1.

HSPA6, also known as Heat Shock 70kDa Protein 6, is a stress-inducible member of the heat shock protein family. It is involved in the folding and refolding of proteins, preventing aggregation, and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation. It plays a crucial role in protecting cells from stress-induced damage and is typically upregulated in response to stress conditions such as heat shock.

2. IL1R1, the Interleukin 1 Receptor Type 1, is a key player in the inflammatory response. It binds interleukins such as IL1α and IL1β, which are important cytokines in the initiation of the inflammatory response. Activation of IL1R1 leads to the activation of NF-kB and MAPK signaling pathways, which are involved in the transcription of various inflammatory genes.

3. ENPP2, also known as Autotaxin, has lysophospholipase D activity that produces lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a signaling molecule involved in cell proliferation, survival, and migration. It plays a role in various biological processes including wound healing and inflammation.

4. GJA1, or Connexin 43, is a component of gap junctions that allows for direct intercellular communication. It is involved in the propagation of calcium waves and can influence inflammatory responses by mediating the passage of small signaling molecules between cells.

5. SRGN, Serglycin, is a proteoglycan found in the intracellular granules of various immune cells, including mast cells and neutrophils. It is involved in the storage and secretion of proteases and other mediators during the immune response.

6. ADIRF, Adipogenesis Regulatory Factor, is implicated in adipocyte differentiation and may play a role in metabolic regulation. While not directly linked to stress or inflammation, its role in adipose tissue can indirectly affect inflammatory processes due to the role of adipose tissue in cytokine production and immune function.

7. AKR1B1, Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member B, is involved in the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism and has been implicated in the development of diabetic complications, which are often associated with oxidative stress and inflammation.

8. The remaining proteins, including 1060P11.3, HIST1H2AC, MAN1A1, FOLR1, MAGEA3, and MRPS2, have diverse functions ranging from histone modification (HIST1H2AC) to mitochondrial protein synthesis (MRPS2). While they may not directly relate to a single cohesive biological process, their individual roles can contribute to cellular homeostasis and stress responses in a broader sense.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the cellular response to stress and inflammation. They participate in the protection against stress-induced damage, mediate inflammatory signaling, and contribute to the regulation of immune responses. The interplay between these proteins supports the cellular capacity to respond to and survive environmental stressors and inflammatory stimuli."	0.85	0	2/24	0.0001067760790024	0.0191326293463452	GJA1;FOLR1	Dicarboxylic Acid Transport (GO:0006835)	Dicarboxylic Acid Transport 	GO:0006835	SLC13A2 SLC26A1 SLC13A3 SLC13A5 SLC22A6 SLC46A1 SLC1A1 SLC1A3 UCP2 SLC1A7 GIPC1 GJA1 PDPN SLC17A6 SLC26A8 SLC17A8 SLC25A10 SLC25A32 FOLR3 FOLR2 SLC19A1 FOLR1 SLC26A7 SLC26A6	0.3120384	0.0571428571428571	True	False	"1.

These proteins are associated with a wide range of biological functions and processes, and there is no clear, singular biological process that prominently encompasses the majority of these proteins.

1. Proteins such as ANPEP (alanyl aminopeptidase) and MME (membrane metallo-endopeptidase) are involved in proteolytic processes, but their specific substrates and biological contexts vary widely.

2. ANXA4 (annexin A4) and CA2 (carbonic anhydrase II) are associated with ion transport and pH regulation, yet they operate in different cellular environments and have distinct physiological roles.

3. CD52, a glycoprotein involved in immune responses, and HSPA6 (heat shock protein family A member 6), a stress response protein, are indicative of the diversity in this protein set, as they participate in unrelated cellular processes.

4. Collagen proteins such as COL1A2 and COL3A1 are structural components of the extracellular matrix and are involved in tissue integrity and wound healing, which is a different domain of biological function compared to the other proteins listed.

1. Metabolic enzymes (e.g., AKR1B10, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, ALDH3A1, ME1) that participate in different metabolic pathways, with no clear dominance of any particular pathway.[1][2][3]

2. Transport proteins (e.g., ABCB6, SLC16A3, SLC7A11) that are involved in the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes, each with distinct substrate specificities.[4][5][6]

3. Stress response proteins (e.g., HMOX1, HSPA2, HSPA6, TXN, TXNRD1) that are implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress and the maintenance of protein homeostasis.[7][8][9]

4. Transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins (e.g., FOSL1, KLF4, ETS2, HES1) that regulate gene expression, each with different target genes and roles in cell differentiation and development.[10][11][12]

5. Cytokines and chemokines (e.g., CXCL6, CXCL8, TNFAIP3, TNFAIP6) that mediate various aspects of the immune response and inflammation, with diverse effects on immune cells.[13][14][15]

6. Proteins involved in the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion (e.g., ITGA3, VIM, CYR61) that contribute to tissue architecture and cell migration.[16][17][18]

7. Proteins with roles in proteostasis and protein turnover (e.g., UCHL1, RAD23B, RNF167) that are involved in protein degradation and quality control.[19][20][21]

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a unifying theme or pathway, it is not possible to assign a single biological process to this system of interacting proteins. The proteins listed do not collectively represent a coherent process such as ribosome biogenesis, DNA repair, or signal transduction. Instead, they seem to be involved in a multitude of cellular processes that are not directly related to each other.

Therefore, the most appropriate name for the biological process performed by this system is ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the protein functions and the absence of a predominant biological process. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a single, prominent biological process within this system of proteins.

Several proteins in this system are directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis. DHCR7, FDFT1, and MSMO1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. DHCR7 catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, FDFT1 is involved in the first committed step of sterol synthesis, and MSMO1 is responsible for the conversion of methylsterol intermediates to cholesterol.

2. INSIG1 and LDLR are critical in cholesterol regulation. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. LDLR is a cell-surface receptor responsible for the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is a primary mechanism for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream.

3. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fats are components of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides, and they play a role in the fluidity and function of biological membranes, which can indirectly affect cholesterol metabolism.

4. The presence of other proteins such as PXDN and CLDN10, which are involved in extracellular matrix formation and tight junctions respectively, suggests additional roles in tissue organization and integrity, which may be related to the broader context of cholesterol metabolism and its impact on cellular structures.

5. Proteins like TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2) indicate a connection to signaling pathways that can influence cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which may intersect with cholesterol metabolism in complex ways, such as in the regulation of cell growth and the synthesis of membrane components.

To summarize, the prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is centered around cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation. The system includes enzymes directly involved in the production of cholesterol, proteins that regulate its synthesis and uptake, and factors that may influence or be influenced by cholesterol metabolism in the context of cell signaling and structural integrity.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities, including but not limited to, signal transduction, metabolism, cell structure and motility, immune response, and gene regulation. Here is a brief analysis of the functional diversity within the system:

1. Proteins like ANXA4 (Annexin A4) and FLNA (Filamin A) are involved in cellular structural integrity and signal transduction pathways. They play roles in cytoskeletal organization and cellular responses to external stimuli.

2. ARG2 (Arginase 2) and ODC1 (Ornithine Decarboxylase 1) are metabolic enzymes involved in the urea cycle and polyamine biosynthesis, respectively, which are crucial for liver function and cell proliferation.

3. CCL20 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 20) and CXCL8 (Interleukin 8) are chemokines that mediate inflammatory responses and are involved in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection or injury.

4. CD24 and MSN (Moesin) are implicated in cell adhesion and signal transduction, with roles in cancer progression and metastasis.

5. DDIT4 (DNA-Damage-Inducible Transcript 4) and JUN are involved in stress response and apoptosis, as well as in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.

6. NTRK2 (Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2) and STMN2 (Stathmin 2) are associated with neural development and function.

7. Proteins like INSIG1 (Insulin Induced Gene 1) and SLC27A2 (Solute Carrier Family 27 Member 2) are involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid transport.

8. Several proteins such as POLG2 (Polymerase Gamma 2), RAD23B (RAD23 Homolog B), and RRP12 (Ribosomal RNA Processing 12 Homolog) are associated with DNA repair, protein quality control, and ribosome biogenesis.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and systemic functions, including but not limited to signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune response, metabolism, and cellular structure. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Signal Transduction: Proteins such as EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) and NTRK2 (Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2) are involved in cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and survival. GRB14 is an adaptor protein that interacts with insulin receptors and may modulate insulin signaling.

2. Immune Response: CCL13 and CCL18 are chemokines involved in the immune response, attracting immune cells to sites of inflammation. CD59 is a complement regulatory protein that inhibits the complement membrane attack complex.

3. Metabolism: Enzymes like CPM (Carboxypeptidase M) and CTSB (Cathepsin B) are involved in protein processing and degradation. ALDH1A2 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A2) is involved in retinoic acid biosynthesis, which is important for cellular differentiation and metabolism.

4. Extracellular Matrix and Cell Adhesion: Proteins such as LAMA4 (Laminin Subunit Alpha 4) and TGFBI (Transforming Growth Factor Beta-Induced) are implicated in cell adhesion and the composition of the extracellular matrix.

5. Transcription Factors and Development: SOX9 and SOX11 are transcription factors involved in development and cell fate determination. PLAGL1 (Pleomorphic Adenoma Gene-Like 1) is a zinc finger protein that may play a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

6. Cellular Structure: Keratins such as KRT5, KRT13, and KRT14 are structural proteins of epithelial cells. They contribute to the mechanical integrity of cells and tissues.

7. Proteolysis and Inhibition: Proteins like PLAU (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator) are involved in proteolysis, whereas SERPINB9 is a serine protease inhibitor.

A significant number of proteins in this system, such as AURKA, BIRC5 (Survivin), BUB1, CENPA, CENPF, DBF4, DLGAP5, GTSE1, KIF14, KIF18B, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C, MKI67 (Ki-67), NEK2, PLK1, SPAG5, TTK, UBE2C, and UBE2S, are directly involved in the regulation and progression of the cell cycle. These proteins function in various stages of cell division, including chromosome segregation, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis.

2. Proteins such as CCND2 (cyclin D2) and CDKs (not listed but implied by the presence of cyclins) are crucial for the transition through the G1/S checkpoint in the cell cycle. CCNF (cyclin F) also plays a role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G2 phase.

3. Proteins like FDXR, GADD45A, and DDIT4 are involved in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage, which can lead to cell cycle arrest. This indicates a system that not only promotes cell division but also has checks and balances to ensure genomic integrity.

4. The presence of proteins such as FAS and DKK3, which are involved in apoptosis and cell signaling pathways, suggests a link between cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death, further emphasizing the system's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

5. Proteins like EMP1, CD44, and CDH1 are associated with cell adhesion and signaling, which can influence cell cycle progression and tissue architecture, indicating a broader role in tissue maintenance and possibly cancer biology.

6. The system also includes proteins like ASPM and AURKA, which are implicated in neurogenesis and spindle orientation, respectively, suggesting a potential role in the development and differentiation of specific cell types.

7. Several proteins, such as LGALS3BP and SERPINA1, are involved in various cellular processes, including immune response and protease inhibition, which may indirectly influence cell cycle progression through cellular signaling pathways.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into the regulation and progression of the cell cycle, with additional roles in DNA damage response, apoptosis, and cell adhesion. The interplay between these proteins ensures proper cell division, genomic integrity, and tissue homeostasis, which are critical for normal development and the prevention of diseases such as cancer."	0.92	0	9/111	1.2849448690744814e-09	1.0446601785575534e-06	TPX2;PSRC1;KIF18B;SPAG5;PLK1;KIF14;KIF23;KIF2C;DLGAP5	Mitotic Sister Chromatid Segregation (GO:0000070)	Mitotic Sister Chromatid Segregation 	GO:0000070	KLHL22 SPICE1 EML3 EML4 ZW10 SGO1 CHMP4C CHMP4A RAN ABRAXAS1 ABRAXAS2 NCAPG BCCIP NCAPH NSL1 CDC23 KNSTRN CHEK2 FLNA KMT5A CLASP1 KNTC1 MISP CLASP2 KIF22 PLK1 NCAPH2 INO80 KIF25 TEX14 KIF23 PDCD6IP TUBG2 TUBG1 WAPL NDC80 KIF18A STAG1 KIF18B LSM14A STAG2 TPX2 KIF2A KIFC2 KIFC1 CHMP2B CHMP3 CHMP2A KIF2C CHMP7 ARHGEF10 CHMP5 CHMP6 CDCA5 NCAPG2 CUL3 CDCA8 SMC4 SMC2 SMC3 CCNB1 KIF3B CHMP1B GOLGA2 NUP62 CHMP1A PIBF1 CEP192 NUDC RHOA BOD1 PHF13 OFD1 SMC1A ZWINT CENPE CENPI ESPL1 CENPK SEH1L KIF11 PINX1 VPS4A VPS4B KIF14 TENT4A DSN1 RRS1 CEP55 DLGAP5 MAP9 SPAG5 PRC1 MZT1 RAB11A KPNB1 PSRC1 WRAP73 NCAPD2 NCAPD3 CCDC61 BECN1 DCTN2 AKAP8L MIS12 TTN ZNF207 ANKRD53 NUSAP1 SPDL1 DIS3L2	0.51968	0.0476190476190476	True	False	"1.

Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), HMGCS1 (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase), FDFT1 (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1), DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase), and DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase), are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, which is responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis. These enzymes work sequentially to convert acetyl-CoA into cholesterol.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) is a regulatory protein that inhibits the proteolytic activation of SREBPs (sterol regulatory element-binding proteins), which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, including cholesterol. This indicates a feedback mechanism to maintain lipid homeostasis.

3. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the uptake of cholesterol from the blood, which is critical for maintaining cellular cholesterol levels and preventing hypercholesterolemia.

4. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. This process is essential for the creation of membrane phospholipids and the storage of triglycerides.

5. ACLY (ATP citrate lyase), ACSL1 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1), and FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) are involved in the synthesis and modification of fatty acids, which are crucial components of cellular membranes and signaling molecules.

6. LPIN1 (lipin 1) and ME1 (malic enzyme 1) are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and energy production. LPIN1 acts as a phosphatidate phosphatase, playing a role in triglyceride biosynthesis, while ME1 is involved in the conversion of malate to pyruvate, producing NADPH for biosynthetic processes.

7. FOXO1 and FOXO3 (forkhead box O1 and O3) are transcription factors that can regulate the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and lipid metabolism, indicating a broader regulatory role in metabolic processes.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of cholesterol and other lipids. They participate in a tightly regulated network that ensures the balance of lipid synthesis, uptake, and storage, which is critical for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and signaling, as well as overall energy homeostasis. The interplay between these proteins demonstrates a coordinated control of lipid metabolism, with implications for understanding diseases related to cholesterol and lipid dysregulation."	0.92	0	10/28	2.4952986509208602e-17	2.5626717144957235e-14	ACLY;SQLE;HMGCS1;INSIG1;CYP51A1;MSMO1;DHCR24;HMGCR;DHCR7;FDFT1	Sterol Biosynthetic Process (GO:0016126)	Sterol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0016126	G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 LSS DHCR24 ACLY SQLE GLB1 PLPP6 MVD DHCR7 CES1 MVK FAXDC2 INSIG2 INSIG1 PRKAG2 HMGCR HSD17B7 MSMO1 CH25H TM7SF2 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 LBR FDFT1	0.5967574	0.0925925925925925	True	False	"1.

Several proteins in this system are directly involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1) is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase) catalyzes the final step in cholesterol synthesis. FDFT1 (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1) is responsible for the first committed step in cholesterol production, the synthesis of squalene from farnesyl diphosphate.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) plays a regulatory role in cholesterol synthesis. It binds to sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and retains them in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing their processing and subsequent activation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the uptake of cholesterol from the bloodstream, providing feedback regulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis.

3. FASN (fatty acid synthase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of fatty acids, a process closely related to the production of cholesterol, as both pathways share precursors and regulatory mechanisms.

4. Several other proteins in the system, such as DDX17 (DEAD-box helicase 17) and KDELR3 (KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 3), may not be directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis but can influence the process indirectly through their roles in RNA processing and protein trafficking, respectively.

5. The presence of NOTCH2 (Notch homolog 2) suggests a link to cellular differentiation and proliferation, which could be related to the demand for cholesterol in membrane synthesis during cell growth.

6. The system also includes proteins with more diverse functions that do not directly relate to cholesterol metabolism, such as AGTR1 (angiotensin II receptor type 1) involved in blood pressure regulation, and BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like) which is implicated in apoptosis and autophagy.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, indicating a strong emphasis on cholesterol homeostasis. The interplay between enzymes of the biosynthesis pathway, regulatory proteins, and receptors ensures tight control of cholesterol levels within cells and throughout the body. However, the presence of proteins with unrelated functions suggests that not all components of the system are dedicated to this process, which is reflected in the confidence score."	0.85	0	4/24	2.2985745069071898e-07	7.417159659397872e-05	HMGCS1;INSIG1;DHCR24;FDFT1	Secondary Alcohol Biosynthetic Process (GO:1902653)	Secondary Alcohol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:1902653	CES1 MVK G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 INSIG2 INSIG1 HMGCR LSS DHCR24 HSD17B7 MSMO1 TM7SF2 ACLY GLB1 PLPP6 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 LBR MVD DHCR7 FDFT1	0.3842399	0.0615384615384615	True	False	"1.

These proteins have diverse functions and are involved in various biological processes, which makes it challenging to identify a single prominent biological process that they collectively perform.

1. 1060P11.3 is a hypothetical protein with unknown function, and its role in biological processes is not well characterized.

2. AZGP1 (Alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, zinc-binding) is involved in lipid mobilization and may play a role in cancer cachexia.

3. CD24 is a cell adhesion molecule that has roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, and is also implicated in cancer progression.

4. COL11A1 (Collagen type XI alpha 1 chain) is a component of the extracellular matrix and is involved in tissue integrity and repair.

5. GAGE3 is a member of the GAGE cancer/testis antigen family and is typically expressed in various cancers.

6. HBP1 (HMG-box transcription factor 1) is a transcriptional repressor that can influence cell proliferation and differentiation.

INSIG1 is an ER membrane protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that regulate the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. LDLR is responsible for the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, thus reducing plasma cholesterol levels.

3. IDI1 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1) is involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is a precursor to cholesterol synthesis.

4. CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) and DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4) may indirectly influence cholesterol biosynthesis through their roles in gene expression and stress response, respectively.

5. Other proteins such as GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase pi 1), SERPINE2 (serpin family E member 2), and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) are involved in various cellular processes including detoxification, blood coagulation, and cell-matrix interactions, which may not directly relate to cholesterol biosynthesis but could influence the overall cellular environment in which cholesterol metabolism occurs.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the synthesis, regulation, and homeostasis of cholesterol, a fundamental component of cell membranes and precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids. The system reflects a coordinated network of enzymes and regulatory proteins that ensure the balance of cholesterol levels within cells and throughout the body."	0.92	0	9/25	2.3634335852693133e-18	1.2337123315105817e-15	HMGCS1;INSIG1;CYP51A1;SC5D;MSMO1;HMGCR;DHCR7;FDFT1;CES1	Cholesterol Biosynthetic Process (GO:0006695)	Cholesterol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0006695	G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 LSS DHCR24 ACLY GLB1 PLPP6 MVD DHCR7 CES1 MVK INSIG2 INSIG1 HMGCR HSD17B7 MSMO1 TM7SF2 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 SC5D LBR FDFT1	0.78023106	0.140625	True	False	"1.

Several proteins in this system, such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, are members of the cytochrome P450 family, which are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and play a critical role in the detoxification of harmful substances. These enzymes contribute to the biotransformation of drugs, carcinogens, and endogenous compounds, and are essential for cellular defense against chemical stress.

2. G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which provides reducing power to cells (in the form of NADPH) for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is also crucial for the synthesis of nucleotides.

3. HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1) is an inducible enzyme that degrades heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron. It is a vital protective molecule against oxidative stress and has anti-inflammatory properties.

4. NQO1 (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) and GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein alpha) are involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and DNA repair. NQO1 also protects cells from oxidative damage by catalyzing the two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones.

5. The transcription factors FOSL1, JUN, MAFF, and KLF4 are part of the AP-1 complex, which regulates gene expression in response to a variety of stimuli, including oxidative stress, and plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

6. Proteins such as TIPARP (TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) and DHRS2 (dehydrogenase/reductase member 2) are involved in the regulation of transcription and cellular response to chemical stressors.

7. The presence of acute phase response proteins like CXCL8 (interleukin 8) indicates a role in the inflammatory response, which is often associated with cellular stress and tissue damage.

8. UGDH (UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase) contributes to the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans, which are important for the extracellular matrix and can be involved in cellular recovery and repair mechanisms.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated to protect the cell from chemical and oxidative stress, to detoxify harmful substances, and to maintain cellular integrity in response to damage. They achieve this through a combination of enzymatic detoxification, antioxidant defense, stress-induced signaling, and regulation of gene expression related to stress response pathways.

6. RGS4 is a member of the regulator of G protein signaling family, which regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways involved in various processes, including neurotransmission.[12][13][14]

7. SDC2, or Syndecan-2, is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan that participates in cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell-matrix interactions.[15][16][17]

8. THBD, or Thrombomodulin, functions as a cofactor in the inactivation of coagulation factors and has anticoagulant properties.[18][19][20]

9. TLR4 is a toll-like receptor that plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity.[21][22][23]

10. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration, particularly in the context of cancer and leukocyte homing.[24][25][26]

11. CEACAM5, also known as CEA, is a cell adhesion molecule involved in cell signaling and is commonly used as a tumor marker in colorectal cancer.[27][28][29]

12. DTX4 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that may regulate Notch signaling, a pathway involved in cell differentiation.[30][31][32]

13. GALNT12 is an enzyme that catalyzes the initial reaction in O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, which can affect protein stability and localization.[33][34][35]

14. MLLT11 is a transcription factor associated with chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias and may play a role in hematopoiesis.[36]

15. PRG2, or Proteoglycan 2, is a major constituent of eosinophil granules and may be involved in modulating the inflammatory response.[37][38][39]

16. ZNF131 is a zinc finger protein that likely functions as a transcriptional regulator, but its specific biological processes are not well characterized.[40][41][42]

In summary, the proteins listed are involved in a wide array of biological processes, including cell adhesion, immune response, transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, and coagulation. There is no clear evidence of a single, prominent biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins. Therefore, this system appears to be a collection of unrelated proteins, each with distinct functions and roles in various biological contexts.

Several proteins in this system, such as ATF3, DDIT4, HMOX1, and NUPR1, are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. ATF3 is a transcription factor that is rapidly induced by various stress signals. DDIT4 is a modulator of the mTOR pathway, which is a key regulator of cell growth and stress response. HMOX1 encodes heme oxygenase 1, which is involved in the degradation of heme and has a protective role in oxidative stress. NUPR1 is a stress-induced protein that plays a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

2. Proteins like CCND2, ID4, IGFBP5, and PDGFRA are associated with cell cycle regulation and growth. CCND2 is a cyclin that drives cells through the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. ID4 acts as a regulator of cell growth by inhibiting differentiation and maintaining cells in a proliferative state. IGFBP5 is involved in the regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) activity, which is critical for cell growth and development. PDGFRA is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the platelet-derived growth factor family, and it plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.

3. The presence of histone proteins HIST1H1C, HIST1H2AC, and HIST1H2BD suggests involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, which are processes that can be linked to stress response and tumor suppression through the regulation of gene expression.

4. Tumor suppressive functions are also indicated by proteins such as ANXA1, which has anti-inflammatory properties and a potential role in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. SERPINA3 is a serine protease inhibitor that can influence apoptosis, and PROS1 (Protein S) is known to have anticoagulant and cytoprotective activities.

5. The system includes proteins like VEGFA, which is a major regulator of angiogenesis, and FN1, which encodes fibronectin, a glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and migration processes. These proteins are crucial in the context of tumor growth and metastasis.

6. Stress granule-associated proteins such as TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA1) and G3BP stress granule assembly factor 1 (G3BP1) are not explicitly listed, but their involvement in stress response pathways could be inferred through the presence of other stress-related proteins.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response mechanisms and tumor suppressive activities. They participate in the regulation of cell cycle, response to oxidative stress, chromatin remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation. The system reflects a multifaceted response to cellular stress that can contribute to the suppression of tumorigenesis."	0.85	1	7/132	1.3800010022839148e-06	0.000738990536723	ANXA1;AKR1C1;KRT14;AKR1C2;GATA3;VEGFA;PCK2	Epithelial Cell Differentiation (GO:0030855)	Epithelial Cell Differentiation 	GO:0030855	SPINK5 KRT4 KRT3 PIH1D1 KRT9 SCRIB GRHL2 WT1 TOLLIP GSTA2 GSTA1 RHCG CES1 PCNA YAP1 EHF TAGLN DEUP1 ASCL1 SCUBE1 BASP1 AKT1 ZNF703 AKT2 HSF4 KDR E2F4 E2F7 E2F8 LOC100653049 GSTK1 JAG1 FZD7 KRT36 KRT35 PLAAT1 KRT34 PLAAT3 TDRD7 KRT32 OVOL2 KRT31 OVOL1 UPK3A OVOL3 MAF LATS1 KRT39 CDHR2 KRT38 KRT37 TAGLN2 TPP1 CCNO FGFR2 VIL1 UPK2 GATA6 DNPH1 GATA3 KRT40 CNN3 LGALS3 MCIDAS FN3K CTSB ANXA1 ANXA4 KRT14 EDF1 KRT13 KRT12 KRT10 UPK1A VEGFA PAX2 CRYGD BMP4 SULT1B1 DAB2 KRT19 KRT17 KRT16 KRT15 CDK1 IRF6 ALDOC DLX3 CITED1 MESP1 KRT25 KRT24 KRT23 KRT20 KRT33B UPK1B CASP6 ERBB4 KRT28 KRT27 KRT33A KRT26 PGK1 PCK2 PCK1 KDM6B SETSIP TBX1 CBR1 CPT1A AKR1C2 AKR1C1 PROX1 ACTL8 DHRS9 RAB10 BDH2 TST PPARG HNRNPH3 VDAC1 HDAC1 HDAC2 SIX1 ZDHHC7 FSTL1 TCF21 GLI1 PTER SIX3 DMBT1 ANXA7	0.33128795	0.0334928229665071	True	False	"1.

1. Metabolic enzymes like AKR1B10, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, ALDH3A1, ALDH3A2, G6PD, and ME1 are involved in various metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, detoxification, and redox homeostasis.

2. Transport proteins such as ABCB6, AQP9, SLC48A1, SLC7A11, and SLC7A7 are implicated in the movement of molecules across cellular membranes, including ions, water, and small solutes.

3. Stress response proteins like HMOX1, HSPA1A, and HSPA6 are part of the cellular response to various stress conditions, including oxidative stress and heat shock.

4. Transcription factors and gene regulators such as BCL6, FOSL1, HES1, and SOX4 play roles in the control of gene expression and are involved in diverse processes like development, differentiation, and immune response.

5. Signaling molecules like IRS2, KCNJ2, and TRIB3 are involved in signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular responses to external stimuli.

The proteins 1060P11.3, DNAJB1, and SQSTM1 are associated with cellular stress responses. DNAJB1 is a co-chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins and the stabilization of unfolded proteins, which is crucial during cellular stress. SQSTM1, also known as p62, is involved in autophagy and is a key adaptor in selective autophagy, which is a process that degrades damaged or unnecessary cellular components.

2. FOSL1 is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, which is involved in various cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is often activated in response to stress signals and contributes to the regulation of genes involved in the immune response.

3. GCLM is a subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione, an important antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress.

4. HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 are MHC class II molecules that play a critical role in the immune system by presenting peptide antigens to T cells, which is essential for the adaptive immune response.

5. ALOX5 is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators that play a role in the immune response and inflammation.

6. AQP3 is an aquaglyceroporin that facilitates the transport of water, glycerol, and other small solutes across cell membranes, which can be important in cellular responses to osmotic stress.

7. CNPY3, CXADR, FHL1, KCNK3, SEPT6, SERPINA1, and TM4SF1 are proteins with diverse functions ranging from protein folding (CNPY3), cell adhesion (CXADR), regulation of muscle development (FHL1), potassium ion transport (KCNK3), cytoskeletal organization (SEPT6), protease inhibition (SERPINA1), to cell signaling and migration (TM4SF1). These proteins may contribute to various cellular processes, including stress responses and immune regulation, but their roles in this specific system of interacting proteins are less direct compared to the aforementioned proteins.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in managing cellular stress and regulating immune responses.

HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. It is subject to complex regulation by various mechanisms, including feedback inhibition by cholesterol derivatives.

2. HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1) is another key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, catalyzing the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is then reduced by HMGCR.

3. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) is a regulatory protein that binds to HMGCR and facilitates its degradation, thus playing a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis. It acts as a mediator of sterol-regulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HMGCR.

4. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, which is a primary mechanism for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream and regulating intracellular cholesterol levels.

5. PCSK1 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1) is an enzyme that processes precursor proteins into their active forms. It is involved in the maturation of proteins that participate in cholesterol metabolism, such as proproteins that become receptors or enzymes in lipid metabolic pathways.

The proteins listed above are directly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, indicating a system primarily engaged in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation.

Other proteins in the system, such as 1060P11.3, AEBP1, AMIGO2, CNPY3, FABP7, PLK2, RCAN1, SCGB1D2, SCGB2A2, ST6GAL1, TFAP2A, VTCN1, APLP2, BAG3, CDC42EP3, FERMT1, HSPB8, ID1, KCNJ15, STX1A, UBE2S, VCAN, WFDC2, and ZNF652, may have roles in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune response, and protein folding. However, their direct involvement in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation is not as clear from the information provided. Therefore, while the primary process is confidently identified, the presence of these additional proteins suggests a broader range of cellular activities, which slightly lowers the confidence score.

Several proteins in this system, such as ATF3, DDIT4, EGR1, and JUN, are immediate-early response genes that are rapidly induced by various stress signals. These transcription factors play critical roles in the cellular response to stress, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and metabolic imbalance. They often function to inhibit cell cycle progression and promote repair mechanisms or apoptosis if the damage is irreparable.

2. Proteins like BCL3, BHLHE41, and IRF1 are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell survival. BCL3 is an atypical member of the IκB family and can modulate apoptosis through its interaction with NF-κB. IRF1 has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis in response to viral infection or DNA damage.

3. The presence of CYP1B1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, indicates a role in xenobiotic metabolism and the cellular oxidative stress response. CYP1B1 is involved in the metabolic activation of various procarcinogens.

4. INSIG1 and LPIN1 are key regulators of lipid metabolism. INSIG1 plays a role in cholesterol synthesis by mediating feedback control of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). LPIN1 is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and is also linked to the control of inflammatory responses.

5. Proteins such as MYC and NR4A1 are transcription factors that can influence cell proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known oncogene that regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cell growth and division, while NR4A1 is involved in various processes including inflammation, metabolism, and apoptosis.

6. The presence of SMAD3 points to a role in the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is known to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. SMAD3 is a key mediator of TGF-β signals and can induce apoptosis in certain cell contexts.

7. TXNIP and VLDLR are involved in oxidative stress and lipid metabolism, respectively. TXNIP is a thioredoxin-interacting protein that inhibits thioredoxin's antioxidant function, thereby modulating cellular redox states. VLDLR is a receptor that mediates the endocytosis of lipoprotein particles and is involved in lipid transport and metabolism.

8. STAT1 is a critical component of the interferon signaling pathway, which is activated in response to viral infections and other stressors. It plays a role in the induction of genes that are involved in antiviral defense, apoptosis, and inflammation.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the cellular response to various forms of stress, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and metabolic disturbances. They function to regulate cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and survival pathways. The system also includes proteins that modulate lipid metabolism and the body's response to xenobiotics, which can be sources of cellular stress. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to maintain cellular homeostasis and integrity in the face of internal and external stressors."	0.92	4	4/43	1.1614535316611297e-06	0.0001344963189663	EGR1;JUN;SMAD3;MYC	Positive Regulation Of miRNA Transcription (GO:1902895)	Positive Regulation Of miRNA Transcription 	GO:1902895	EGR1 NGFR SMAD3 SREBF1 TGFB1 POU2F1 IL10 JUN TGFB2 STAT3 FOS MRTFB MRTFA GNL3 KLF5 KLF4 APLN SMARCA4 FOSL1 MYCN WT1 PPARG TP53 FOXA1 RELA SPI1 SRF PRL PDGFB TNF ETS1 FGF2 GATA3 HIF1A EGFR FOXO3 GATA2 NR3C1 ATOH8 MYB TERT MYC TEAD1	0.19906668	0.0526315789473684	True	False	"1.

The proteins ADM, CXCL8, and WNT5A are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. ADM (adrenomedullin) has vasodilatory properties and can promote angiogenesis, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory chemokine that can recruit immune cells to the tumor site, potentially contributing to inflammation and tumor progression. WNT5A is part of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation.

2. Proteins such as BNIP3L, DDIT4, and EGLN3 are associated with cellular responses to hypoxia, a common feature of the tumor microenvironment. BNIP3L (also known as NIX) is involved in hypoxia-induced apoptosis and autophagy. DDIT4 (REDD1) is a regulator of the mTOR pathway in response to hypoxia. EGLN3 (PHD3) is a prolyl hydroxylase that regulates the stability of HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor), a key transcription factor in hypoxic response.

3. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, and proteins such as HK2, PDK1, PFKFB3, PGK1, and ALDOA are key players in this process. HK2 (hexokinase 2) catalyzes the first step of glycolysis and is often upregulated in cancer cells. PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, reducing the flow of pyruvate into the TCA cycle and promoting glycolysis. PFKFB3 regulates the production of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent activator of glycolysis. PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) and ALDOA (aldolase A) are glycolytic enzymes that facilitate the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, providing energy and biosynthetic precursors for rapidly proliferating cancer cells.

4. The proteins AURKA, CCNB1, CDC20, CDC25B, PLK1, and TOP2A are involved in cell cycle regulation and mitosis, processes that are often dysregulated in cancer. AURKA (aurora kinase A) and PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1) are critical for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and CDC25B (cell division cycle 25B) are important for the G2/M transition. TOP2A (topoisomerase II alpha) is essential for DNA replication and chromosome separation.

5. The immune response is also represented by proteins such as HLA-B, STAT1, and IFIT1. HLA-B is a major histocompatibility complex class I molecule involved in the presentation of peptide antigens to T cells. STAT1 is a transcription factor that mediates the response to interferons, which have anti-tumor effects. IFIT1 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) is induced by interferons and can have antiviral and anti-proliferative roles.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of cancer progression, including modulation of the tumor microenvironment, metabolic reprogramming, cell cycle regulation, and immune response. The interplay between these proteins can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. The majority of the proteins listed contribute to these processes, indicating a high level of functional integration within the system."	0.88	1	5/27	6.79616698836998e-08	3.076533379762886e-05	CDC20;UBE2C;UBE2S;PLK1;TRIB3	Positive Regulation Of Ubiquitin-Protein Transferase Activity (GO:0051443)	Positive Regulation Of Ubiquitin-Protein Transferase Activity 	GO:0051443	FBXW7 PLK1 UBE2C ARRDC4 AXIN1 CDC20 TOPORS PINK1 UBE2S TRIB3 PIN1 UBE2N DCUN1D4 DCUN1D5 DCUN1D2 DCUN1D3 PTEN DCUN1D1 BMI1 CDC14B UBE2L3 FZR1 MAGEA2 MAGEC2 RPS2 BTRC SKP1	0.26130748	0.0490196078431372	True	False	"1.

These proteins are involved in a wide array of biological processes, and there is no clear, singular biological process that prominently encompasses the majority of these proteins.

1. Several proteins such as CRYAB, PLEC, and S100A11 are involved in cellular structural integrity and stress responses. CRYAB is a small heat shock protein that provides cytoprotection against stress conditions, while PLEC is a cytolinker that connects the cytoskeleton to the cellular membrane.

2. Proteins like EIF4B and HNRNPA3 are involved in RNA processing and translation regulation, indicating roles in gene expression control.

3. FABP5 and CYB561 are associated with lipid and redox metabolism, respectively. FABP5 is involved in the transport of fatty acids and other lipids within cells, and CYB561 is involved in electron transport across membranes.

4. GAA is a lysosomal enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown, and its deficiency leads to glycogen storage diseases.

5. IGFBP4 and MSLN are involved in growth regulation and signaling. IGFBP4 binds insulin-like growth factors, modulating their activity, while MSLN is a mesothelin that may play a role in cell adhesion.

6. Transcription factors such as KLF9, MAFB, and WT1 have roles in gene expression regulation during development and in adult tissues, with WT1 being critical for kidney and gonadal development.

7. Proteins like FGFR2 and HLA-DQA1 are involved in cell signaling and immune response. FGFR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase important for cell growth and differentiation, and HLA-DQA1 plays a role in antigen presentation for immune surveillance.

8. NDP, PEG3, and SRSF7 have diverse functions ranging from eye development (NDP), to imprinting and apoptosis (PEG3), and splicing regulation (SRSF7).

Given the diversity of functions and lack of a unifying biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that these proteins do not collectively represent a singular, prominent biological process."	0.0	0	2/7	2.88738312533813e-05	0.0076226914508926	KLF9;FGFR2	Negative Regulation Of Keratinocyte Proliferation (GO:0010839)	Negative Regulation Of Keratinocyte Proliferation 	GO:0010839	KLF9 MED1 CYP27B1 SNAI2 PTPRK EPPK1 FGFR2	0.18183574	0.0689655172413793	False	False	"The provided list of proteins includes 1060P11.3, C6ORF62, CRYAB, CYB561, EIF4B, FABP5, GAA, IGFBP4, KLF9, MAFB, NEBL, PHLDA1, PLEC, S100A11, BCHE, FGFR2, HLA-DQA1, HNRNPA3, ISOC1, MSLN, NDP, PEG3, SRSF7, and WT1.

CRYAB is a small heat shock protein that provides cytoprotection against stress conditions, while PLEC is a cytolinker that connects the cytoskeleton to the cellular membrane.[1][2][3]

2. Proteins like EIF4B and HNRNPA3 are involved in RNA processing and translation regulation, indicating roles in gene expression control.[4][5][6]

3. FABP5 and CYB561 are associated with lipid and redox metabolism, respectively. FABP5 is involved in the transport of fatty acids and other lipids within cells, and CYB561 is involved in electron transport across membranes.[7][8][9]

4. GAA is a lysosomal enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown, and its deficiency leads to glycogen storage diseases.[10][11][12]

5. IGFBP4 and MSLN are involved in growth regulation and signaling. IGFBP4 binds insulin-like growth factors, modulating their activity, while MSLN is a mesothelin that may play a role in cell adhesion.[13][14]

6. Transcription factors such as KLF9, MAFB, and WT1 have roles in gene expression regulation during development and in adult tissues, with WT1 being critical for kidney and gonadal development.[15][16][17]

7. Proteins like FGFR2 and HLA-DQA1 are involved in cell signaling and immune response. FGFR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase important for cell growth and differentiation, and HLA-DQA1 plays a role in antigen presentation for immune surveillance.[18][19][20]

8. NDP, PEG3, and SRSF7 have diverse functions ranging from eye development (NDP), to imprinting and apoptosis (PEG3), and splicing regulation (SRSF7).[21][22][23]

Given the diversity of functions and lack of a unifying biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that these proteins do not collectively represent a singular, prominent biological process.

Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1), FDPS (farnesyl diphosphate synthase), SQLE (squalene epoxidase), LSS (lanosterol synthase), DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase), and CYP51A1 (lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase), are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. These enzymes are involved in the sequential conversion of acetyl-CoA to cholesterol.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) is a regulatory protein that controls the cholesterol synthesis pathway by mediating the retention of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing their activation. When cholesterol levels are low, SREBPs are transported to the Golgi apparatus to be processed and then enter the nucleus to activate genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake, including HMGCR and LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor).

3. LDLR is a cell surface receptor that mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, which is a primary mechanism for the removal of cholesterol from the bloodstream and its delivery to peripheral tissues.

4. IDI1 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1), FDPS, and MSMO1 (methylsterol monooxygenase 1) are also involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and non-sterol isoprenoids, which are critical for various cellular functions, including membrane integrity and protein prenylation.

5. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is involved in fatty acid metabolism, specifically the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. This process is important for the fluidity of cell membranes and is also linked to the regulation of lipid metabolism, including cholesterol.

6. Proteins such as CDKN1B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B) and SFN (14-3-3 sigma) are involved in cell cycle regulation and may indirectly influence cholesterol biosynthesis by affecting cell proliferation and the overall metabolic demands of cells.

7. The presence of proteins like SERPINA1 (alpha-1-antitrypsin) and CCL20 (chemokine ligand 20) suggests additional roles in inflammation and immune response, which can be modulated by lipid mediators derived from cholesterol metabolism.

8. Other proteins in the system, such as CALM3 (calmodulin 3), PLCB1 (phospholipase C beta 1), and HSPA2 (heat shock protein family A member 2), are involved in signal transduction and stress responses, which may interact with cholesterol metabolism pathways or be affected by membrane composition changes due to cholesterol levels.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, a fundamental component of cell membranes and precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids. The system also includes proteins that may influence cholesterol metabolism indirectly through cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. The interplay between these proteins ensures the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis, which is critical for cellular function and overall organismal health."	0.92	0	8/28	6.652013049242466e-17	3.292746459375022e-14	SQLE;HMGCS1;INSIG1;CYP51A1;MSMO1;HMGCR;DHCR7;LSS	Sterol Biosynthetic Process (GO:0016126)	Sterol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0016126	G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 LSS DHCR24 ACLY SQLE GLB1 PLPP6 MVD DHCR7 CES1 MVK FAXDC2 INSIG2 INSIG1 PRKAG2 HMGCR HSD17B7 MSMO1 CH25H TM7SF2 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 LBR FDFT1	0.7302654	0.1509433962264151	True	False	"1.

7. Other proteins like LITAF (involved in endosomal trafficking), EPN2 (epsin 2, implicated in endocytosis), and EXPH5 (exophilin 5, associated with vesicle trafficking) are related to intracellular transport mechanisms, yet they do not form a coherent process when considered collectively.[14]

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a unifying theme among the proteins listed, it is not possible to assign a prominent biological process to this system. The proteins appear to be involved in various unrelated cellular processes, and their interactions do not suggest a singular, overarching biological function. Therefore, the most accurate description for this system is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" and the confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in a unified process name for this group of proteins.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, GADD45B, HMOX1, and NUPR1, are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. DDIT4 regulates cellular growth by modulating the mTOR pathway, which is sensitive to nutrient and energy stress levels. GADD45B participates in the response to environmental stress and is involved in the regulation of growth and apoptosis. HMOX1 is an inducible enzyme that degrades heme and has a protective role against oxidative stress. NUPR1 is implicated in the cellular stress response and can modulate apoptosis, cell cycle, and DNA repair.

2. Inflammation and immune response modulation are represented by proteins such as HLA-DQA1, which is part of the MHC class II complex and is involved in the presentation of peptides to the immune system. CXCL8, also known as interleukin-8, is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils and other immune cells to sites of inflammation.

3. Proteins like MYC and CCNE2 are involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. MYC is a well-known transcription factor that controls the expression of numerous genes involved in cell growth and apoptosis. CCNE2, Cyclin E2, is essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S transition.

4. The presence of several heat shock proteins (HSPs) such as HSPA1A, HSPA8, and DNAJA1 indicates a role in protein folding and protection against cellular stress and damage. These HSPs act as molecular chaperones, assisting in the proper folding of nascent and stress-accumulated proteins.

5. FABP4 and FABP5 are fatty acid-binding proteins involved in the intracellular transport of lipids, which play roles in metabolic processes and inflammation. FABP4 is particularly associated with adipocytes and macrophages and has been implicated in the development of metabolic syndrome.

6. VEGFA is a major growth factor for endothelial cells and is involved in angiogenesis, which is crucial for processes such as wound healing and response to ischemic conditions.

7. The presence of ZFP36 and ZFP36L2, both of which are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, suggests a role in the regulation of mRNA stability and degradation, particularly in inflammatory and immune response genes.

8. Proteins like SLC1A4, a transporter for neutral amino acids, and PCK2, an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis, indicate metabolic adaptation and energy management in response to cellular stress.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a coordinated response to cellular stress and inflammation. They participate in the regulation of gene expression, protein folding, immune response, cell cycle control, metabolic processes, and angiogenesis. The interplay between these proteins suggests a complex network that modulates cellular homeostasis in response to internal and external stressors. The name ""Cellular Stress Response and Inflammation Modulation"" reflects the prominent processes of stress response and inflammation management, with a high proportion of the genes contributing to these functions."	0.88	0	4/17	4.3179158259415774e-08	4.240193341074628e-05	ZFP36;KLF9;ZFP36L2;PCK2	Cellular Response To Glucocorticoid Stimulus (GO:0071385)	Cellular Response To Glucocorticoid Stimulus 	GO:0071385	HNRNPU ZFP36L1 FAM107A SSTR2 ISL1 NR3C1 SSTR4 AQP1 SSTR5 UBE2L3 ZFP36L2 KLF9 BCL2L11 ZFP36 REST PCK2 PCK1	0.5447889	0.0714285714285714	True	False	"1.

Several proteins in this system, such as FADS1, FASN, HMGCS1, INSIG1, LDLR, LSS, MSMO1, SCD, and SQLE, are directly involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis. FADS1 is involved in the desaturation of fatty acids, a critical step in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. FASN is a key enzyme in de novo lipogenesis, catalyzing the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. HMGCS1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis.

2. INSIG1 is a regulatory protein that mediates feedback control of cholesterol synthesis by binding to sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). LDLR is a receptor that mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. LSS, MSMO1, and SQLE are all enzymes involved in the multi-step process of cholesterol synthesis, with SQLE being a rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway.

3. SCD is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are important components of membrane phospholipids and also serve as lipid signaling molecules.

4. Other proteins in the system, such as CYP1B1 and SERPING1, have roles that are tangentially related to lipid metabolism. CYP1B1 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of various lipophilic compounds, and SERPING1 is a serine protease inhibitor that can influence inflammation and vascular function, processes that are affected by lipid metabolism.

5. The remaining proteins, including 1060P11.3, HSPA6, PEG3, PTBP3, RHOB, RPL37A, RPL38, ACTG2, BCHE, CASP1, CD40, CDKN2A, MAGEA3, RGS1, RGS2, SORL1, WLS, and NPY1R, are involved in a diverse array of biological processes. These range from protein synthesis (RPL37A, RPL38), stress response (HSPA6), apoptosis (CASP1), cell cycle regulation (CDKN2A), to signal transduction (RGS1, RGS2) and neurotransmission (NPY1R). While these proteins have important roles in cellular function, they do not directly contribute to the central process of lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis, with a significant number of proteins directly participating in these pathways. However, the presence of proteins with diverse and unrelated functions suggests that this system also engages in other cellular processes, which is reflected in the confidence score."	0.85	0	5/28	5.12905296691877e-10	2.231138040609666e-07	SQLE;HMGCS1;INSIG1;MSMO1;LSS	Sterol Biosynthetic Process (GO:0016126)	Sterol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0016126	G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 LSS DHCR24 ACLY SQLE GLB1 PLPP6 MVD DHCR7 CES1 MVK FAXDC2 INSIG2 INSIG1 PRKAG2 HMGCR HSD17B7 MSMO1 CH25H TM7SF2 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 LBR FDFT1	0.7268362	0.0943396226415094	True	False	"1.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular pathways, including but not limited to, lipid metabolism, immune response, oxidative stress response, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. Here is a brief overview of the diversity of functions:

1. Several proteins such as FADS1, HMGCS1, INSIG1, SCD, and SQLE are involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. These proteins contribute to the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and other lipids, which are vital for cell membrane integrity and signaling.

2. Proteins like CFB (complement factor B) and IL17RB (interleukin 17 receptor B) are implicated in the immune response, with roles in the complement system and cytokine signaling, respectively.

Several proteins in this system, such as ATF3, FOSB, IER3, PPP1R15A, and XBP1, are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. ATF3 and FOSB are immediate-early response genes that are rapidly induced by various stress signals and play roles in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis. IER3 also functions in the cellular response to stress and has been implicated in apoptosis regulation. PPP1R15A, also known as GADD34, is involved in the recovery from stress-induced eukaryotic translation inhibition. XBP1 is a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response, a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum.

2. Proteins such as ACSL1, CYP1B1, GSTP1, HMGCS2, and SLC2A3 are involved in metabolic processes. ACSL1 is an acyl-CoA synthetase that plays a role in fatty acid metabolism. CYP1B1 is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. GSTP1 is a glutathione S-transferase that participates in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics. HMGCS2 is the rate-controlling enzyme of ketogenesis. SLC2A3, also known as GLUT3, is a glucose transporter with a role in glucose uptake in cells.

3. Proteins such as BRD2, GATA3, SOX4, and CCND2 are transcription factors or regulators of gene expression. BRD2 is a member of the BET family of proteins that regulate gene expression epigenetically. GATA3 is a transcription factor important for T-cell development and differentiation. SOX4 is involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of cell fate. CCND2 is a cell cycle protein that regulates the G1/S transition.

4. Other proteins like LDLR, LTF, and PLAUR are involved in various cellular processes. LDLR is a receptor for low-density lipoproteins, playing a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis. LTF, lactotransferrin, has antimicrobial activity and is involved in iron transport. PLAUR, or urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor, is involved in the activation of plasminogen and plays a role in processes such as cell migration and tissue remodeling.

5. Lastly, proteins such as ANXA3, ID3, MT1E, NUPL1, SFRP1, STOM, TIPARP, CD200, COL4A5, DPYSL3, KCNMA1, PPP1R3C, SRC, and ZW10 are involved in various cellular functions ranging from cell signaling, cell adhesion, and migration to ion transport and cytoskeletal organization.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a broad range of biological processes, with a significant number participating in the cellular stress response and metabolic regulation. These proteins interact to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress conditions and regulate metabolic pathways. The system reflects a complex interplay between stress response mechanisms and metabolic control, ensuring cellular adaptation and survival in response to internal and external stimuli."	0.85	6	2/9	0.0001002294974893	0.011870036202664	XBP1;GATA3	Response To Interleukin-4 (GO:0070670)	Response To Interleukin-4 	GO:0070670	LEF1 XBP1 DCSTAMP RUFY4 XCL1 TCF7 SHPK GATA3 JAK3	0.36231512	0.048780487804878	True	False	"1.

CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. It is a receptor for hyaluronic acid and can interact with other ligands, such as osteopontin, collagens, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). CD44 is implicated in a wide variety of cellular functions including lymphocyte activation, recirculation and homing, hematopoiesis, and tumor metastasis.

2. CDH1, also known as E-cadherin, is a type of cadherin specifically involved in the formation of adherens junctions to bind cells with each other. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining the epithelial cell layer structure. Loss of E-cadherin function or expression is often implicated in cancer progression and correlates with poor prognosis.

3. CDKN1C (p57, Kip2) is a potent tight-binding inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes and a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Alterations in this gene are implicated in the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of tumor development.

4. CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), is a chemokine that plays a role in angiogenesis and is a chemoattractant for T cells and monocytes. It is also involved in the homing of hematopoietic cells to the bone marrow and its receptor, CXCR4, is often overexpressed in cancer cells, facilitating metastasis.

5. FGFR3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and repair. Mutations in FGFR3 are associated with several forms of skeletal dysplasia and are also found in a number of cancers, including bladder and cervical cancers.

6. SPARC (osteonectin) is a matricellular protein that modulates cell-matrix interactions and functions in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. It is associated with changes in the extracellular matrix and is often found to be overexpressed in cancers, where it can influence growth, invasion, and metastasis.

7. VWF (von Willebrand factor) is involved in hemostasis, mediating the adhesion of platelets to sites of vascular injury. It has also been implicated in angiogenesis and tumor progression.

8.

3. There are proteins that participate in cell signaling and regulation (e.g., KRAS, SRC), but they are not focused on a single signaling pathway or regulatory process.

4. Proteins like ANXA4 and ANXA6 are involved in membrane-related processes, whereas others like CPE and PTPRN2 have roles in vesicular trafficking and secretion.

Given the wide range of functions and the lack of a clear common biological process, it is not possible to assign a single prominent biological process to this system of interacting proteins. The proteins listed do not appear to be functionally integrated into a specific biological pathway or process that is predominant over the others. Therefore, the most appropriate name for this system is ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the diverse and unrelated nature of the biological processes they are involved in. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a unifying biological process for this group of proteins.

The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a cellular defense mechanism activated by various stress conditions, including amino acid deprivation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Proteins such as ATF3, ATF4, DDIT3 (also known as CHOP), and GADD45A are key transcription factors and downstream effectors in the ISR. They regulate gene expression to restore cellular homeostasis or induce apoptosis if the stress is too severe.

2. ER-associated proteins like DNAJC10 (ERdj5), DNAJC3 (P58IPK), EDEM1, HERPUD1, HSPA5 (BiP/GRP78), and SERP1 are involved in protein folding and the unfolded protein response (UPR), a subset of the ISR. These proteins help to alleviate ER stress by enhancing the degradation of misfolded proteins and improving the protein folding capacity of the ER.

3. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as CARS, GARS, IARS, and WARS are essential for protein synthesis, linking amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs. Under stress conditions, they can have non-canonical functions, including signaling roles in the ISR.

4. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of proteins that provides structural support to cells and tissues. COL1A1 and COL4A5 are collagen proteins that contribute to the ECM's integrity. LAMB1 is a laminin, crucial for basement membrane assembly. THBS2 and CHI3L1 are involved in ECM remodeling and cell-matrix interactions.

5. Proteins like HMGCR and HMGCS1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis, which is tightly regulated by cellular stress and energy status. LDLR is involved in cholesterol uptake, and SCD is a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis, indicating a link between stress response and lipid metabolism.

6. Several proteins in the system, such as ASS1, ASNS, PSAT1, and GFPT1, are involved in amino acid metabolism and the cellular response to amino acid availability, which is closely related to the ISR.

7. MYC is a well-known oncogene and transcription factor that regulates various cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. Its activity can be influenced by stress responses and nutrient availability.

8. The presence of proteins like CD163, CFH, and VSIG4, which are involved in immune responses and inflammation, suggests a connection between stress responses and immune modulation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the cellular response to various stress conditions, particularly the ISR and UPR, which aim to restore homeostasis through transcriptional regulation, protein folding, and degradation. Additionally, there is a significant involvement in ECM remodeling, indicating a functional integration between stress responses and structural cellular components.

Several proteins in this system, including DNAJB9, DNAJC10, DNAJC3, EDEM1, EIF2AK3, HSP90B1, and PDIA4, are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and protein folding. These proteins function as chaperones, foldases, and components of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER.

2. The UPR is a cellular stress response related to the ER and is involved in the quality control of protein folding. Key elements of this response include the upregulation of molecular chaperones (HSP90B1, DNAJB9) and enzymes that facilitate protein folding (PDIA4), as well as signaling pathways that lead to the reduction of protein synthesis and enhancement of degradation pathways to restore ER homeostasis.

3. EIF2AK3, also known as PERK, is a kinase that phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis, which helps to alleviate the protein load on the ER. DDIT3 and DDIT4 are transcription factors that are upregulated during ER stress and contribute to the UPR by regulating genes involved in apoptosis and metabolism.

4. Proteins such as SEC24D and SEC31A are part of the COPII vesicle coat complex and are involved in the ER-to-Golgi transport of proteins, which is essential for proper protein sorting and maturation.

5. The presence of proteins like INSIG1 and SREBP (not listed but related to INSIG1 function) indicates a connection to lipid metabolism and the regulation of cholesterol synthesis, which is also linked to ER function and stress.

6. The protein folding environment is further supported by the presence of numerous chaperones and foldases, such as CALU, HSPA13, and SERP1, which assist in the proper folding and maturation of nascent polypeptides.

7. The system also includes proteins like FICD and TXNIP, which are involved in the regulation of ER stress and redox homeostasis, respectively, further emphasizing the role of this protein system in maintaining ER function and cellular homeostasis under stress conditions.

Several proteins in this system, including DNAJB9, DNAJC10, DNAJC3, EDEM1, EIF2AK3, HSP90B1, and PDIA4, are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and protein folding. These proteins function as chaperones, foldases, and components of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER.[1][2][3]

2. The UPR is a cellular stress response related to the ER and is involved in the quality control of protein folding. Key elements of this response include the upregulation of molecular chaperones (HSP90B1, DNAJB9) and enzymes that facilitate protein folding (PDIA4), as well as signaling pathways that lead to the reduction of protein synthesis and enhancement of degradation pathways to restore ER homeostasis.[4][5][6]

3. EIF2AK3, also known as PERK, is a kinase that phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis, which helps to alleviate the protein load on the ER. DDIT3 and DDIT4 are transcription factors that are upregulated during ER stress and contribute to the UPR by regulating genes involved in apoptosis and metabolism.[7][8][9]

4. Proteins such as SEC24D and SEC31A are part of the COPII vesicle coat complex and are involved in the ER-to-Golgi transport of proteins, which is essential for proper protein sorting and maturation.[10][11][12]

5. The presence of proteins like INSIG1 and SREBP (not listed but related to INSIG1 function) indicates a connection to lipid metabolism and the regulation of cholesterol synthesis, which is also linked to ER function and stress.[13][14][15]

6. The protein folding environment is further supported by the presence of numerous chaperones and foldases, such as CALU, HSPA13, and SERP1, which assist in the proper folding and maturation of nascent polypeptides.[16][17][18]

7. The system also includes proteins like FICD and TXNIP, which are involved in the regulation of ER stress and redox homeostasis, respectively, further emphasizing the role of this protein system in maintaining ER function and cellular homeostasis under stress conditions.[19][20][21]

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the ER stress response and protein quality control. They work together to ensure proper protein folding, to manage the load of unfolded proteins, and to maintain cellular homeostasis under conditions of ER stress. This system is critical for the survival of cells under stress conditions that disrupt ER function, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and exposure to toxins.

Several proteins in this system, such as DNAJB1, HSPA6, and DDIT4, are involved in the cellular stress response. DNAJB1 and HSPA6 are molecular chaperones that assist in the proper folding of proteins and the response to heat shock and other stressors. DDIT4 is a stress response protein that regulates mTOR signaling, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions.

2. Proteins like COL11A1 and COL2A1 are major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and are involved in its formation and maintenance. MMP13 is a matrix metalloproteinase that degrades components of the ECM, playing a role in tissue remodeling and repair.

3. The presence of antioxidant enzymes such as AKR1C1, AKR1C2, GCLM, HMOX1, and TXNRD1 indicates a system involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protection against oxidative stress. These enzymes work synergistically to maintain cellular redox homeostasis.

4. MYC is a well-known transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cell proliferation, growth, and metabolism. It can interact with other proteins in the system to modulate various cellular processes.

5. Proteins like ABCB6, FOLR1, and SLC7A11 are involved in transport functions across the cell membrane, including the transport of folate (FOLR1) and cystine (SLC7A11), which are important for cell survival and function.

6. The presence of immune-related proteins such as SERPINA3 and components of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IGHM) suggests a role in immune response modulation.

7. Proteins involved in signal transduction and cellular communication, such as RGS5 and BLNK, indicate a system that can respond to extracellular signals and mediate intracellular signaling pathways.

8. The system also includes proteins like LOX, which is involved in the cross-linking of collagen and elastin in the ECM, and FOSL1, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex that regulates gene expression in response to various stimuli.

8. TIMP2 is a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, which is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation.[22][23][24]

9. VEGFA and WNT5A are growth factors involved in angiogenesis and developmental processes, respectively.[25][26][27]

10. The remaining proteins, such as AQP1 (aquaporin 1), ITGAE (integrin alpha-E), and TSPAN7 (tetraspanin 7), among others, are involved in various cellular processes including water transport, cell adhesion, and membrane organization.[28][29][30]

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a unifying biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that there is no single prominent biological process that characterizes the system.

The proteins in this system are involved in a variety of cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress response, and DNA damage response. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and can lead to apoptosis if the damage is irreparable.

2. HSPA1A, DNAJB1, DNAJB6, and DNAJB9 are molecular chaperones that participate in protein folding and the UPR. They help in refolding misfolded proteins or target them for degradation, thus preventing the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates.

3. DDIT4, GADD45A, and ATF3 are involved in the DNA damage response. They are upregulated in response to genotoxic stress and can induce cell cycle arrest to allow for DNA repair or trigger apoptosis if the damage is beyond repair.

4. HMOX1, TXNIP, and TXNRD1 are part of the oxidative stress response. They are involved in the regulation of redox homeostasis and can protect cells from oxidative damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) or by modulating the cellular antioxidant capacity.

5. CDKN1A (p21) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in response to DNA damage. It can induce cell cycle arrest to facilitate DNA repair or, in the context of severe damage, contribute to the induction of apoptosis.

6. PMAIP1 (NOXA) and PPP1R15A (GADD34) are pro-apoptotic proteins that are upregulated during cellular stress and contribute to the initiation of apoptosis. NOXA is involved in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, while GADD34 is part of the integrated stress response and can also promote apoptosis under certain conditions.

7. SERPINA1 and SERPINI1 are serine protease inhibitors that can regulate protease activity in various pathways, including inflammation and cell death.

8. ATF5, ATF3, and HES1 are transcription factors that can modulate the expression of genes involved in stress responses, cell survival, and apoptosis.

9. The presence of multiple histone proteins (e.g., H2BFS, HIST1H1C, HIST1H2AC, HIST1H2BD, HIST1H2BG, HIST1H2BK) suggests a role in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression in response to stress.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated to manage cellular stress through various mechanisms, including protein folding, DNA repair, redox balance, and apoptosis. The system is designed to protect the cell from transient stress, but it can also initiate programmed cell death if the damage is severe and irreparable, thus ensuring the removal of damaged cells and maintaining tissue homeostasis."	0.92	2	4/15	5.504543809644667e-07	0.0002064203928616	NELL2;TFAP2B;GATA3;SOX4	Sympathetic Nervous System Development (GO:0048485)	Sympathetic Nervous System Development 	GO:0048485	TFAP2B SEMA3A FZD3 NTRK1 CTNNB1 SEMA3F GATA3 SOX11 PHOX2B NELL2 SOX4 NELL1 GDNF INSM1 NF1	0.37023383	0.0388349514563106	True	False	"1.

CD40 signaling also contributes to the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells, enhancing the immune response to pathogens.

2. IKZF1 encodes the transcription factor IKAROS, which is crucial for the development and differentiation of lymphocytes, particularly in the early stages of B-cell and T-cell maturation. It is also involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in the immune system.

3. PLCB1 encodes phospholipase C beta 1, an enzyme that plays a significant role in signal transduction pathways. Upon activation by G protein-coupled receptors, PLCB1 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, secondary messengers that modulate various cellular processes including immune cell activation and proliferation.

4. DPYD encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of the pyrimidine bases uracil and thymine. This enzyme is crucial for the breakdown and reuse of nucleotides, which are essential for DNA synthesis and repair, processes that are highly active in proliferating immune cells.

5. PSPH encodes phosphoserine phosphatase, an enzyme involved in the serine biosynthesis pathway. Serine is a non-essential amino acid that is important for cell proliferation, particularly in rapidly dividing cells such as activated immune cells.

6. ASCL1 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the differentiation of neural and neuroendocrine cells. While not directly related to immune function, it may have indirect effects on immune modulation through neuroimmune interactions.

7. GSN encodes gelsolin, an actin-binding protein that is involved in actin filament assembly and disassembly. Gelsolin is implicated in cell motility, which is important for immune cells to navigate through tissues and reach sites of infection or inflammation.

8. HMGCS1 encodes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1, an enzyme involved in the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids. These molecules are important for cell membrane integrity and function, including in immune cells.

9. MAP3K5, also known as ASK1, is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that is involved in stress-induced apoptosis and inflammatory responses. It can be activated by various stress signals and cytokines, playing a role in immune cell regulation.

10. MAP7 encodes a microtubule-associated protein that is involved in stabilizing microtubules and interacting with other proteins for intracellular transport. This function is important for the trafficking of immune receptors and signaling molecules within immune cells.

11. QPCT encodes glutaminyl-peptidase, an enzyme that is involved in the post-translational modification of peptide hormones and other proteins. While its role in immune function is not well characterized, it may influence the stability and activity of peptides involved in immune signaling.

12. SLC27A2 encodes a fatty acid transporter protein involved in the uptake and activation of long-chain fatty acids. Fatty acids are important for the synthesis of lipid mediators of inflammation and for the maintenance of cell membrane fluidity in immune cells.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of immune response modulation, including lymphocyte development, activation, and signaling, as well as cellular metabolism processes that support the proliferation and function of immune cells.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), EPAS1 (Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1), and TSC22D3 (TSC22 domain family protein 3), are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. DDIT4 is a modulator of the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. EPAS1, also known as HIF-2α, is a transcription factor that responds to hypoxia and regulates genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. TSC22D3 is a glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein that can regulate inflammatory responses and cellular growth.

2. The presence of metabolic enzymes such as ASNS (asparagine synthetase), GLS (glutaminase), PCK2 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2), and PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) indicates a role in metabolic regulation. ASNS is involved in the biosynthesis of asparagine and adaptation to cellular stress, while GLS catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, a key step in energy and nitrogen metabolism. PCK2 is an enzyme in gluconeogenesis, converting oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and PGK1 is a glycolytic enzyme, highlighting the system's involvement in balancing energy production and consumption.

3. Chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL11, along with their regulatory proteins, suggest a role in immune response and inflammation. These chemokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, which is critical during stress and injury.

4. Proteins like CAV1 (caveolin 1) and ENPP2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2) are involved in signal transduction and lipid metabolism, respectively. CAV1 is a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes, influencing various signaling pathways, while ENPP2 is involved in the generation of lysophosphatidic acid, a lipid signaling molecule.

5. Growth factors and their regulators, such as AREG (amphiregulin), EREG (epiregulin), BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4), and FAM129A (family with sequence similarity 129 member A), are indicative of roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development.

6. The presence of XIST (X inactive specific transcript) suggests a connection to epigenetic regulation, as XIST is involved in X-chromosome inactivation, a process of dosage compensation in females.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, immune response, signal transduction, and growth factor activity. The system appears to be geared towards maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes, with a significant number of proteins contributing to these processes.

ACO1, also known as aconitase 1, is a key enzyme in the TCA cycle and functions as an iron regulatory protein. When cellular iron levels are low, ACO1 binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs) in mRNA, regulating the stability and translation of mRNAs involved in iron metabolism.

2. CDKAL1 is implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion and beta-cell function. It is known to modulate the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and has been associated with type 2 diabetes risk, suggesting a role in glucose homeostasis.

3. CDX2 is a homeobox transcription factor involved in the regulation of intestinal development and differentiation. Its role in this protein system may be peripheral but could suggest a link to nutrient absorption processes that indirectly affect pancreatic function.

4. CIAO1, CITED2, FAM96A, FAM96B, and FBXL5 are proteins involved in cellular iron homeostasis. CIAO1 is part of the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly components, essential for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. CITED2 regulates the response to hypoxia and may influence cellular metabolism. FAM96A and FAM96B are part of the iron regulatory network, and FBXL5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase sensor for iron, targeting proteins for degradation in iron regulation.

5. IREB2 is an iron-responsive element-binding protein that post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of genes involved in iron metabolism, such as ferritin and transferrin receptor.

6. KDM5B is a histone demethylase that may regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure, potentially influencing genes involved in pancreatic development or function.

7. MAFA is a transcription factor that regulates insulin gene expression in pancreatic beta-cells and is crucial for beta-cell function.

8. MMS19 is part of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex, which is involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, essential cofactors for many cellular enzymes.

9. PCIF1 is a phosphoribosyl-linked serine ubiquitination writer that may play a role in mRNA cap regulation, with potential implications for gene expression control in pancreatic cells.

10. PDX1 is a transcription factor essential for pancreatic development, beta-cell maturation, and maintenance of beta-cell function. It regulates the expression of insulin and other genes important for pancreatic function.

11. RTEL1 is a DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability, which is crucial for the proper function of all cells, including pancreatic cells.

12. TFAP2C is a transcription factor that can influence the development and differentiation of various tissues, including roles in the pancreas.

In summary, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the regulation of iron metabolism, which is critical for many cellular processes, including those in the pancreas. The system also includes proteins that directly regulate pancreatic development and function, particularly in beta-cells. The interplay between iron homeostasis and pancreatic function is evident, as iron is essential for the proper function of many enzymes and regulatory proteins within the pancreas.

DTWD1 and DTWD2 are proteins containing DTW domains, which are implicated in protein-protein interactions. While specific roles in DNA repair are not well-established, proteins with DTW domains are often involved in regulatory functions that could influence DNA repair pathways.

2. POLD2 and POLD4 are subunits of DNA polymerase delta, which plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair. POLD2 is the accessory subunit, while POLD4 is a smaller subunit that may have a role in stabilizing the complex and interacting with other proteins during DNA synthesis and repair.

3. POLH and POLI encode DNA polymerases eta and iota, respectively. These are Y-family DNA polymerases involved in translesion synthesis (TLS), a process that allows DNA replication to occur despite the presence of lesions that would otherwise stall the replication fork.

4. RAD18 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is crucial for post-replication repair of DNA. It monoubiquitinates PCNA, facilitating the recruitment of Y-family polymerases to sites of stalled replication due to DNA damage.

5. REV1 and REV3L encode proteins that are part of the translesion synthesis machinery. REV1 is a deoxycytidyl transferase that inserts cytosine opposite lesions that obstruct replication. REV3L is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, which extends from the nucleotides inserted by REV1 and other TLS polymerases.

6. TBC1D19 is a protein with a role in intracellular trafficking. Its connection to DNA repair is not direct, but it may influence the process by regulating the localization and turnover of proteins involved in DNA repair pathways.

7. TTLL1 is a tubulin tyrosine ligase-like protein. While its primary function is related to post-translational modifications of tubulin, such modifications can indirectly affect cell cycle progression and DNA repair processes.

8. UBE2V1 and UBE2V2 are ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that work with RAD18 to facilitate PCNA monoubiquitination, a key step in the activation of the TLS pathway.

9. WRNIP1 (Werner helicase interacting protein 1) is involved in the processing of stalled replication forks and may function in the restart of DNA replication following fork stalling.

10. ZNF611 is a zinc finger protein, and while zinc finger proteins are often involved in DNA binding and transcription regulation, the specific role of ZNF611 in DNA repair is not well characterized.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in the DNA damage tolerance and repair pathways, particularly in the context of translesion synthesis and post-replication repair mechanisms. These proteins work together to ensure that replication can continue past DNA lesions, with various enzymes contributing to lesion bypass, extension past the damage, and subsequent repair processes.

ATAD5 is a protein that plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair. It is involved in the regulation of the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) trimer, which is essential for DNA polymerase function during DNA replication. ATAD5 is known to facilitate the unloading of PCNA from DNA after replication and repair processes, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability.

2. FANCI is a key component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, a DNA repair mechanism that is particularly important for the repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). FANCI forms a complex with FANCD2, which is monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage. This modification is crucial for the activation of the FA pathway and coordination of ICL repair with the replication machinery.

3. PHLPP1 (PH domain and Leucine rich repeat Protein Phosphatase 1) is a phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth, survival, and metabolism. While PHLPP1 is not directly involved in DNA repair, its role in cell signaling can influence cellular responses to DNA damage and stress, potentially impacting the efficiency of DNA repair processes.

4. RAD51AP1 (RAD51 Associated Protein 1) is directly involved in the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, a high-fidelity DNA repair process. RAD51AP1 interacts with RAD51, a recombinase that facilitates the search for homology and strand pairing during HR. RAD51AP1 enhances the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51, promoting efficient repair of double-strand breaks.

5. USP1 (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 1) and its cofactor WDR48 (WD Repeat Domain 48) are involved in the deubiquitination of FANCD2 and PCNA. USP1-WDR48 complex regulates the FA pathway by reversing the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, which is necessary for the completion of ICL repair. Additionally, USP1 deubiquitinates PCNA, modulating the balance between DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways.

6. USP12 is another deubiquitinating enzyme that can potentially regulate protein stability and function through the removal of ubiquitin modifications. While its specific role in DNA repair is less characterized, it may contribute to the regulation of protein turnover and function in the DNA damage response.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity through various DNA repair mechanisms. They interact in pathways that respond to DNA damage, such as the Fanconi anemia pathway and homologous recombination, and regulate the activity of key proteins through post-translational modifications. The system ensures the proper coordination of DNA repair with the replication machinery and cell cycle progression, which is essential for preventing genomic instability and maintaining cellular homeostasis."	0.92	8	1/7	0.0024477534600423	0.0114228494801974	RAD51AP1	Positive Regulation Of Meiotic Nuclear Division (GO:0045836)	Positive Regulation Of Meiotic Nuclear Division 	GO:0045836	PRDM9 RAD51AP1 NPM2 PRDM7 SIRT2 STRA8 OOEP	0.27214706	0.0769230769230769	True	False	"1.

EGFR, or Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by binding of its specific ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). Upon activation, EGFR undergoes a transition from an inactive monomeric form to an active homodimer. This dimerization leads to autophosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the C-terminal domain of EGFR, which initiates a variety of downstream signaling pathways. These pathways include the MAPK, Akt, and JNK pathways, which are involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.

2. NR3C1, also known as the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), is a steroid hormone receptor that regulates gene expression in response to glucocorticoids. Upon ligand binding, NR3C1 translocates to the nucleus where it can act as a transcription factor, influencing the expression of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. It plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammatory responses, metabolism, and stress responses.

PRDX1, PRDX2, and PRDX5 are members of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes, which reduce peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, to water and alcohol, respectively. These enzymes play a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by regulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). They also participate in redox signaling by modulating the activity of various transcription factors and signaling molecules.

It is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis.

The proteins in this system are functionally integrated to manage cellular responses to oxidative stress and to regulate signal transduction pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

2. NDUFA13, also known as GRIM-19, is a subunit of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) that is involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It plays a role in the production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.

3. PGLS, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, is an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis that generates NADPH and pentoses (5-carbon sugars) as well as ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides.

4. UBA52 is a fusion protein consisting of ubiquitin at the N-terminus and ribosomal protein L40 at the C-terminus. It functions in protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and also plays a role in ribosome biogenesis.

5. USE1, also known as UBL4A, is a ubiquitin-like protein that is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (ERAD). It is part of the machinery that targets misfolded proteins for degradation.

AURKA, Aurora kinase A, is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in mitotic spindle assembly, centrosome separation and maturation, and chromosome segregation. It is activated by binding to TPX2 and is involved in the regulation of the timing of mitotic events.

2. CKAP5, also known as cytoskeleton-associated protein 5 or ch-TOG, is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and is involved in spindle fiber dynamics. It interacts with TACC proteins to contribute to the stabilization of spindle microtubules.

3. TACC1 and TACC2 (transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein 1 and 2) are members of the TACC family, which are known to play roles in stabilizing microtubules and are involved in the regulation of mitotic progression. They interact with CKAP5 and contribute to the proper assembly of the mitotic spindle.

4. YEATS4, also known as GAS41, is a component of the chromatin-modifying complexes and has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and cell cycle progression. While its direct role in spindle assembly is less clear, it may influence mitotic events through chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

In summary, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of mitosis, specifically in the assembly and stabilization of the mitotic spindle and the accurate segregation of chromosomes. AURKA acts as a key regulator, while CKAP5, TACC1, and TACC2 form a complex that directly stabilizes microtubules.

The proteins CDH1, CDH2, CDH3, CLDN3, CLDN4, CLDN7, CRB3, OCLN, and TACSTD2 are all involved in the formation and maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and tight junctions, which are critical for the establishment of epithelial cell polarity and barrier function. Cadherins (CDH1, CDH2, CDH3) mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, while claudins (CLDN3, CLDN4, CLDN7) and occludin (OCLN) are integral components of tight junction strands that seal the space between epithelial cells.

2. Proteins such as EPCAM, GRHL2, GRHL3, IRF6, and KLF4 are transcription factors or regulatory molecules that play roles in epithelial cell differentiation, proliferation, and the transcriptional regulation of genes important for maintaining epithelial characteristics.

Cilia play essential roles in motility, sensory perception, and signal transduction. The majority of the proteins mentioned contain coiled-coil domains (CCDC), tetratricopeptide repeats (TTC), or are otherwise implicated in ciliary structure and function.

1. Proteins such as DNAH2, DNAH10, DNAL1, and DNALI1 are dynein heavy and light intermediate chains, which are motor proteins that drive the bending motion of cilia and flagella. Their coordinated activity is crucial for ciliary motility.

2. CCDC proteins, including CCDC30, CCDC74A, CCDC74B, and CCDC103, are often involved in the assembly, maintenance, and function of cilia. CCDC proteins can contribute to the structural integrity of the axoneme, the central shaft of a cilium, or play roles in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system that is essential for ciliogenesis and the movement of molecules along the ciliary length.

3. Proteins such as CFAP43, CFAP45, and CFAP52 are cilia- and flagella-associated proteins that are implicated in the proper formation and function of cilia. Mutations in these proteins can lead to ciliary defects and related disorders.

4. NPHP1, TMEM67 (also known as Meckelin), and TCTN2 are proteins associated with the ciliopathy nephronophthisis and Joubert syndrome, respectively. These proteins are involved in the signaling pathways and structural integrity of cilia.

MST1R, also known as the Macrophage Stimulating 1 Receptor or RON tyrosine kinase receptor, is primarily involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as growth, survival, and differentiation. It is activated by its ligand, Macrophage Stimulating Protein (MSP), and is implicated in wound healing, immune responses, and potentially in the invasive growth of cancer cells. MST1R signaling can lead to the activation of various pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, and the JAK/STAT pathway, which are critical for cell proliferation and survival.

2. PRPF31 is a component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA. It is involved in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing, which is a crucial process for the generation of mature, translatable mRNA molecules. Mutations in PRPF31 are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, indicating its importance in the maintenance of retinal cell function.

3. SUB1, also known as PC4, is a multifunctional protein that has roles in transcriptional coactivation, DNA repair, and the regulation of transcriptional elongation. It binds to single-stranded DNA and interacts with RNA polymerase II, influencing the transcription of specific genes. SUB1 is also implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage and is involved in maintaining genome stability.

To summarize, the proteins MST1R, PRPF31, and SUB1 are involved in distinct biological processes: MST1R in cell signaling and growth regulation, PRPF31 in mRNA processing, and SUB1 in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair.

The proteins HSP90AA1, HSPA1A, and HSPA1B are molecular chaperones that play a critical role in protein folding, preventing aggregation, and assisting in the refolding of misfolded proteins. They are central to the cellular stress response and are involved in the protein quality control system.

2. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is represented by proteins such as UBC, UBE2G1, PSMD14, PSMC5, and STUB1. These proteins are involved in tagging misfolded or damaged proteins with ubiquitin for degradation and recycling by the proteasome, thus maintaining protein homeostasis.

3. IDE (Insulin-degrading enzyme) is a protease that degrades small proteins, including insulin and amyloid-beta, indicating a role in both glucose regulation and the prevention of amyloid plaque formation.

4. The endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway is suggested by the presence of proteins like MARCH6 and OSBP, which are involved in the recognition and translocation of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol for degradation.

5. Intracellular trafficking and vesicular transport are indicated by proteins such as AP3B1, SNAP29, TRAPPC8, and TRAPPC11, which are components of the vesicle-mediated transport system, including the trafficking of proteins between the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes.

6. Proteins like ACTR10, DYNC1H1, and DNAJC14 are involved in the cytoskeletal network and vesicle movement, which are essential for intracellular transport and cellular organization.

7. The protein complex assembly and RNA processing are represented by proteins such as RBM8A, SMG8, and SRP9, which are involved in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes and the regulation of mRNA splicing and stability.

BBS9 and BBS10 are part of the BBSome complex, which is involved in the structure and function of cilia, cellular organelles that play a critical role in various signaling pathways and sensory functions. Mutations in these proteins are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction leading to retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, and kidney abnormalities.

2. LZTFL1 and MKKS (also known as BBS6) are also associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome and ciliary function. LZTFL1 is thought to regulate the BBSome complex's ciliary trafficking, while MKKS has a dual role in both ciliogenesis and the cell cycle regulation.

3. TTC8 (also known as BBS8) is another component of the BBSome complex, contributing to the structure and function of cilia. Like BBS9 and BBS10, mutations in TTC8 can lead to Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

4. PSMA5 is a component of the proteasome, a complex responsible for protein degradation, which is essential for many cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and signal transduction. While not directly related to ciliary function, proteasomal activity can influence the turnover of ciliary components and thus indirectly affect ciliary function.

5. RNF19A is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which tags proteins with ubiquitin for degradation by the proteasome. It may have a role in the regulation of proteins involved in ciliary function through targeted degradation.

6. DPP3 is a dipeptidyl-peptidase that cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of protein substrates. It is not directly linked to ciliary function but could be involved in the processing of signaling molecules that participate in ciliary signaling pathways.

To summarize, the majority of the genes in this set encode proteins that are directly involved in the formation, maintenance, and function of cilia, with a strong association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy. The presence of proteins involved in protein degradation suggests a regulatory mechanism for controlling the turnover of ciliary components. The system of interacting proteins appears to be primarily involved in ciliopathy-related processes, with a focus on the BBSome complex and its regulation."	0.88	1	2/21	2.928839492649749e-05	0.0007907866630154	MKKS;BBS10	Chaperone-Mediated Protein Complex Assembly (GO:0051131)	Chaperone-Mediated Protein Complex Assembly 	GO:0051131	MKKS CCT2 HSP90AA1 HSP90AB1 PTGES3 CLU HSPA4 HSPD1 HOPX BBS10 BBS12 THEG HSPA1A NDUFAF1 PSMG2 PSMG3 PTGES3L PFDN6 PSMG1 TMEM35A LONP1	0.4773255	0.074074074074074	True	False	"1.

ACTL6A, CHD3, and ING4 are components of chromatin remodeling complexes that alter the structure of chromatin to regulate access to DNA. ACTL6A is part of the SWI/SNF complex, which is involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes. CHD3 is a member of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex, which has roles in chromatin compaction and gene silencing. ING4 associates with histone acetyltransferase complexes and can modulate chromatin structure and transcription.

2. BCL6, CREBBP, EP300, NR3C1, RELA, RUNX1, TP53, and YY1 are transcription factors or co-regulators that directly influence gene expression. BCL6 is a sequence-specific repressor of transcription, while CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that activate transcription by remodeling chromatin. NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response. RELA is a subunit of NF-kB, a transcription factor involved in inflammatory and immune responses. RUNX1 is critical for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. TP53 (p53) is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in apoptosis, growth arrest, and DNA repair. YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor that can act as an activator, repressor, or initiator-binding protein.

3. H2AFZ and HIST1H4A are histone variants; H2AFZ is a replacement for the canonical histone H2A and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. HIST1H4A is a core component of the nucleosome, and its post-translational modifications are critical for transcriptional regulation.

4. HNRNPD (also known as AUF1) is an RNA-binding protein that influences mRNA stability and turnover, thereby indirectly affecting gene expression.

5. KAT6A and TERT are involved in modifying chromatin structure and telomere maintenance, respectively. KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase that can regulate transcription through chromatin remodeling. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, can also regulate gene expression independently of its role in telomere elongation.

6. MTA3, PML, TBL1XR1, and TNF are involved in various aspects of chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation. MTA3 is a component of the NuRD complex, like CHD3, and is involved in gene silencing. PML is involved in the formation of nuclear bodies and can regulate transcription. TBL1XR1 is part of the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex, which mediates transcriptional repression. TNF is primarily known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine but can also influence gene expression through activation of NF-kB.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure and transcription. They work in concert to modulate gene expression patterns necessary for various cellular processes, including development, metabolism, immune response, and maintenance of genomic integrity. The interplay between these proteins facilitates the precise and context-dependent regulation of transcription, ensuring proper cellular function and response to environmental cues."	0.92	13	4/29	2.096594659934776e-08	9.629359759557578e-07	ING4;CREBBP;KAT6A;EP300	Protein Acetylation (GO:0006473)	Protein Acetylation 	GO:0006473	CREBBP NAA50 LACRT ESCO2 NAA11 ESCO1 NAA10 NAA35 SPHK1 SIRT1 KAT2B HAT1 MAPT NAT10 KAT6A NAA15 NAA16 CLOCK NAA20 DSCC1 GTF2B NAA80 NAA60 FOXO1 ING5 ING4 BLOC1S1 KAT5 EP300	0.41372812	0.0869565217391304	True	False	"1.

3. STIM1 (Stromal interaction molecule 1) and STIM2 are calcium sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that transduce signals to the plasma membrane to control calcium influx, a process essential for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, gene expression, and cell growth.

4. THBS3 (Thrombospondin 3) and THBS4 (Thrombospondin 4) are matricellular proteins that modulate cell-matrix interactions and are involved in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and regulation of synaptogenesis. They can influence intracellular signaling pathways and have roles in the response to stress and injury.

5. ZHX1, ZHX2, and ZHX3 (Zinc fingers and homeoboxes protein 1, 2, and 3) are transcriptional repressors that can form heterodimers and are involved in the regulation of gene expression, including genes related to cell differentiation and development.

6. DYRK4 (Dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 4) is a kinase that may be involved in spermatogenesis and could play a role in signal transduction pathways that are activated in response to stress or changes in cellular energy levels.

7. RNF123 (RING finger protein 123) is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that may be involved in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway, which regulates protein turnover and signal transduction pathways.

8. UBAC1 (UBA domain-containing protein 1) is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and stress responses.

9. UVSSA (UV-stimulated scaffold protein A) is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, a process that repairs DNA damage induced by UV light and other genotoxic stressors.

10. CRIPAK (CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PAK1 knockout) is not a protein but a method for gene editing. It may be a misidentified element in this list, as it does not represent a biological process or protein function.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in various aspects of the cellular stress response, including the modulation of the HPA axis, regulation of calcium signaling, tissue remodeling, gene expression, and DNA damage repair.

The diversity of the protein functions ranges from developmental roles to various signaling pathways and structural components. Here is a brief analysis of the functional categories represented:

1. Developmental Proteins: Proteins like BMP10, DAND5, and PCDH19 are involved in developmental processes. BMP10 is a member of the bone morphogenetic protein family which is involved in cardiac development. DAND5 is a known antagonist of certain TGF-beta signaling pathways, influencing embryonic development. PCDH19 is implicated in the development of the nervous system.

2. Signaling Molecules: Several proteins such as GNRH2, PTCHD1, and PTP4A3 are involved in signaling pathways. GNRH2 is a neuropeptide that plays a role in the regulation of reproductive hormones. PTCHD1 is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development. PTP4A3 is a phosphatase involved in various signaling pathways, including those related to cancer progression.

3. Structural and Transport Proteins: Proteins like MYO15B and SLC14A2 are associated with structural functions or transport. MYO15B is a myosin protein implicated in hair cell development and function in the inner ear. SLC14A2 is a urea transporter, playing a role in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine.

4. Synaptic and Neuronal Proteins: NRXN3 and IGSF9B are involved in neuronal function. NRXN3 is a neuronal cell adhesion molecule implicated in synapse function. IGSF9B is involved in the development of the nervous system and synaptic organization.

5. Miscellaneous Functions: The remaining proteins have diverse roles, such as AGBL4 which is a cytosolic carboxypeptidase, and CDKL4 which is a cyclin-dependent kinase-like protein, potentially involved in cell cycle regulation.

Given the broad spectrum of unrelated functions, it is not possible to assign a single biological process to this system of interacting proteins. The proteins do not collectively represent a coherent pathway or process that can be succinctly named.

The HOX family of proteins, including HOXA1 through HOXA6, HOXA11, HOXB2 through HOXB9, and HOXD3 through HOXD11, are transcription factors that play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. They are known for their involvement in patterning the anterior-posterior axis and specifying regional identity in the developing embryo.

2. The HOXA cluster proteins, such as HOXA1 and HOXA2, are essential for the proper development of the hindbrain and branchial arches. They are also implicated in the differentiation of various cell types and organs, including the limbs, gut, and reproductive system.

3. Similarly, the HOXB cluster proteins, including HOXB2 through HOXB9, are involved in the development of the axial skeleton, limbs, and genitourinary system. They contribute to the segmental organization of the embryo and are crucial for the formation of the vertebral column and thoracic cage.

4. The HOXD cluster proteins, such as HOXD3 through HOXD11, are particularly important for limb development, including the patterning of digits and the establishment of limb identity. They also play roles in the development of the urogenital system and the gastrointestinal tract.

5. The coordinated expression of HOX proteins is tightly regulated and involves complex interactions with other transcription factors, cofactors, and epigenetic modifiers. These interactions ensure the precise spatial and temporal expression patterns required for normal development.

6. The HOX proteins often function in a combinatorial manner, with multiple HOX proteins binding to DNA regulatory elements to control the expression of target genes. This combinatorial code contributes to the diversity of developmental outcomes and the specificity of tissue patterning.

To summarize, the HOX proteins in this system are central to the regulation of developmental gene expression.

ARSA (arylsulfatase A) is involved in the degradation of sulfatides in lysosomes. Deficiency in ARSA activity leads to a lysosomal storage disorder known as metachromatic leukodystrophy, which affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system.

2. CNP (2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase) is an enzyme highly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the production of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides. It plays a role in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath.

3. GALNS (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase) is another lysosomal enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans, specifically keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Deficiencies in GALNS activity result in Morquio A syndrome, a type of mucopolysaccharidosis.

4. MYL7 (myosin light chain 7) is a cardiac-specific myosin light chain that is part of the contractile apparatus of cardiac muscle cells. It plays a role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction.

5. SMARCB1 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1) is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. It is involved in transcriptional regulation and is implicated in tumor suppression.

6. UACA (uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats) is a protein with less well-characterized functions, but it is thought to be involved in apoptosis and may play a role in autoimmune uveitis.

The proteins listed are involved in a variety of biological processes, including lysosomal degradation, myelin sheath maintenance, cardiac muscle contraction, chromatin remodeling, and potentially apoptosis and immune response. There is no single, prominent biological process that encompasses the functions of all these proteins. Instead, they participate in distinct and separate pathways within the cell. The interactions between these proteins, if any, do not suggest a unified biological process.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, overarching biological process, the proteins in this system appear to be involved in unrelated pathways. Therefore, the most appropriate name for the biological process performed by this system is:

The proteins TUBA3C, TUBA3D, TUBA3E, TUBA8, TUBB1, TUBB3, and TUBB8 are all tubulin subunits, which are the building blocks of microtubules. Microtubules are critical for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and are essential components of the mitotic spindle during cell division. These proteins are involved in the polymerization and stabilization of microtubules, affecting cellular dynamics and architecture.

2. MAPRE2 and MAPRE3, also known as EB2 and EB3, are microtubule-associated proteins that bind to the plus-end of microtubules, regulating their dynamics and interactions with other cellular components. They are involved in microtubule-based processes such as mitosis and cell migration.

3. Proteins such as STOM (stomatin) are involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and associated with membrane integrity and ion channel regulation. SCNN1G is a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel and is involved in the regulation of sodium balance and blood pressure.

4. TXNDC9, UCHL1, and ATG4B are involved in protein folding and degradation pathways. TXNDC9 is a thioredoxin domain-containing protein that may be involved in the oxidative stress response. UCHL1 is a ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1, playing a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for protein degradation. ATG4B is a cysteine protease required for autophagy, which is the process of degrading and recycling cellular components.

5. TBCA, TBCE, and TCP1 are chaperonins involved in tubulin folding and the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. These proteins assist in the correct folding of newly synthesized proteins or the refolding of misfolded proteins.

6. TNPO1, TNPO2, and TNPO3 are transportin proteins that mediate the nuclear import of specific proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. They are part of the karyopherin family and are involved in the nuclear transport cycle.

7. XPO1 (also known as CRM1) and XPO6 are involved in nuclear export. XPO1 mediates the nuclear export of a wide variety of proteins and RNAs, while XPO6 is involved in the export of specific proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

8. PFKL and PFKP are isoforms of the enzyme phosphofructokinase, which is a key regulatory enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. They are involved in the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a rate-limiting step in glycolysis.

9. SYT9 is a member of the synaptotagmin family, which are membrane-trafficking proteins that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. NECAB2 is a neuronal calcium-binding protein, which may be involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and neurodevelopment.

10. CA9 (carbonic anhydrase IX) is involved in pH regulation and is associated with the cellular response to hypoxia.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the organization, dynamics, and function of the cytoskeleton, particularly microtubules, and in the intracellular transport of proteins and other molecules. The system also includes proteins that participate in metabolic processes, ion transport, and the cellular stress response.

The proteins AMPH, CPLX2, SNAP25, SNAP91, STX1B, SYN1, SYN2, SYP, SYT1, and SYT5 are all integral to synaptic transmission. They are involved in the docking, priming, and fusion of synaptic vesicles, as well as the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These proteins work in concert to ensure rapid and precise communication between neurons.

2. Proteins such as MAP2, MAPRE3, MAPT, and DCX are associated with microtubule stabilization and dynamics, which are crucial for neuronal structure, axonal transport, and the establishment of neuronal polarity during development and regeneration.

3. CAMKV, CNTN1, DCLK1, DPYSL5, EDIL3, GRIA2, HPCA, HPCAL1, L1CAM, LSAMP, NCALD, and VSNL1 are involved in neuronal signaling and plasticity. They participate in processes such as neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and calcium signaling, which are essential for learning, memory, and the overall function of neural networks.

4. CALB2, GNG2, and SNCB are calcium-binding proteins that regulate intracellular calcium levels, a key second messenger in various neuronal processes, including neurotransmitter release and gene expression.

5. ATP4A is a component of the proton pump responsible for acidifying the stomach. Its inclusion in this system may indicate a peripheral connection to neuronal control of gastric functions or may be an unrelated function.

6. DNAAF2 is known for its role in ciliary function and may be involved in the development of neuronal cilia or could be an outlier in this protein system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the development, structure, and function of neurons, particularly in the context of synaptic transmission and plasticity. The system reflects a complex network of proteins that work together to ensure proper neuronal communication, learning, and memory. The presence of a few proteins with less clear connections to neuronal function suggests additional peripheral roles or a minor degree of unrelated functions within the system."	0.95	2	5/38	6.8019013106744766e-09	8.094262559702627e-07	SNAP25;SYT1;CPLX2;SYN2;SYN1	Signal Release From Synapse (GO:0099643)	Signal Release From Synapse 	GO:0099643	PTPRN2 SNAPIN UNC13A SLC32A1 SYT1 SYN3 SYN2 SYN1 SNPH CDK5 DNAJC5 SYT10 VAMP2 STX1A SNAP25 STXBP1 CPLX1 RAB3A NRXN2 STXBP2 NRXN1 STXBP3 LIN7B LIN7A CPLX3 CPLX2 LIN7C CPLX4 GRM4 PCLO HRH3 DVL1 PDZD11 RIMS1 PIP5K1C OTOF SNCA PPFIA3	0.4905132	0.072463768115942	True	False	"1. The proteins AMPH, CPLX2, SNAP25, SNAP91, STX1B, SYN1, SYN2, SYP, SYT1, and SYT5 are all integral to synaptic transmission. They are involved in the docking, priming, and fusion of synaptic vesicles, as well as the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These proteins work in concert to ensure rapid and precise communication between neurons.[1][2][3]

2. Proteins such as MAP2, MAPRE3, MAPT, and DCX are associated with microtubule stabilization and dynamics, which are crucial for neuronal structure, axonal transport, and the establishment of neuronal polarity during development and regeneration.[4][5][6]

3. CAMKV, CNTN1, DCLK1, DPYSL5, EDIL3, GRIA2, HPCA, HPCAL1, L1CAM, LSAMP, NCALD, and VSNL1 are involved in neuronal signaling and plasticity. They participate in processes such as neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and calcium signaling, which are essential for learning, memory, and the overall function of neural networks.[7][8][9]

4. CALB2, GNG2, and SNCB are calcium-binding proteins that regulate intracellular calcium levels, a key second messenger in various neuronal processes, including neurotransmitter release and gene expression.[10][11]

5. ATP4A is a component of the proton pump responsible for acidifying the stomach. Its inclusion in this system may indicate a peripheral connection to neuronal control of gastric functions or may be an unrelated function.[12][13][14]

6. DNAAF2 is known for its role in ciliary function and may be involved in the development of neuronal cilia or could be an outlier in this protein system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the development, structure, and function of neurons, particularly in the context of synaptic transmission and plasticity. The system reflects a complex network of proteins that work together to ensure proper neuronal communication, learning, and memory. The presence of a few proteins with less clear connections to neuronal function suggests additional peripheral roles or a minor degree of unrelated functions within the system.

BEGAIN, CAMSAP2, CEP170, CLASP1, and CLIP2 are proteins that interact with microtubules, which are components of the cytoskeleton. These proteins are involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules, as well as in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. CAMSAP2 anchors non-centrosomal microtubules to the cell cortex, while CLASP1 and CLIP2 regulate microtubule plus-end dynamics, influencing cell shape, polarity, and motility.

2. KIFC3 is a kinesin motor protein that moves along microtubules and is involved in intracellular transport, particularly in the transport of organelles and vesicles. It plays a role in the distribution of mitochondria and lysosomes within cells.

3. MARCKS is a protein that binds to actin filaments and is implicated in the cross-talk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. It is involved in cell motility, adhesion, and the formation of cellular protrusions.

4. NOP10 is a component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is involved in the processing and modification of rRNA. Although not directly related to cytoskeletal organization or intracellular transport, its interaction with the other proteins could be related to the localization of snoRNP complexes within the cell.

5. NT5C is a 5'-nucleotidase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular nucleotide levels and can indirectly affect various cellular processes, including signaling pathways that may influence cytoskeletal dynamics.

6. TRPV1 is a non-selective cation channel that responds to heat and inflammatory signals. It is primarily known for its role in sensory neurons but can also be expressed in non-neuronal tissues. Its interaction with the cytoskeletal proteins could be related to the regulation of cellular responses to stress or changes in the environment.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the organization, stabilization, and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, as well as in the intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles. The interactions between these proteins suggest a coordinated network that ensures proper cellular architecture and distribution of cellular components. While NOP10 and NT5C are not directly related to these processes, their inclusion in the system may reflect regulatory or localization roles that are yet to be fully understood.

4. Proteins like MYBPC3 are involved in structural components of muscle tissue, while others like MATN1 and MATN4 are involved in extracellular matrix organization, indicating a diversity in structural and organizational roles.

1. Proteins such as ANKRD10, EML5, and the CECR2 are involved in structural and regulatory roles within the cell, but they do not share a common pathway or process.

2. APOA2 is associated with lipid metabolism and transport, while CYP4F22 is involved in fatty acid metabolism, yet these functions do not suggest a unified biological process within this system.

MAGEL2 is a member of the MAGE family and is involved in intracellular trafficking and neurodevelopment. It has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy and endosomal sorting, particularly in neurons. Mutations in MAGEL2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting its critical role in these processes.

2. SNX5, SNX6, and SNX7 are part of the sorting nexin family. These proteins are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking. They play roles in the retromer complex, which is essential for the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. SNX5 and SNX6 have been shown to form a subcomplex that is implicated in the sorting of transmembrane proteins.

3. WASHC3 is a component of the WASH complex, which is involved in the actin-dependent process of endosomal sorting. It plays a role in the fission of tubules that serve as transport intermediates. The WASH complex is critical for the sorting of endosomal cargo and the recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane.

4. WDFY1 is a FYVE domain-containing protein that has been implicated in endosomal trafficking. It is involved in the early stages of autophagosome formation and may act as an adaptor protein that recruits other proteins to the endosome.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the processes of endosomal sorting and trafficking. They contribute to the proper distribution and recycling of cellular components, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental cues. The involvement of these proteins in the retromer complex and the WASH complex highlights their integrated roles in the endosomal system.

MGMT, also known as O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, is involved in the direct repair of alkylated DNA. It removes mutagenic and cytotoxic adducts from the O-6 position of guanine, thereby preventing erroneous base pairing and mutations.

2. MUTYH is a base excision repair enzyme that recognizes and excises oxidatively damaged DNA bases like 8-oxoguanine, which can mispair with adenine, leading to mutations during replication if left unrepaired.

3. TDP1, or tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, functions in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks containing a 3'-end blocking lesion and is particularly important for the resolution of topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes.

4. SLX4IP interacts with SLX4, a structure-specific endonuclease subunit, which is involved in the repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks and in the maintenance of telomeres in association with the telomere maintenance complex.

5. HUS1B is a component of the 9-1-1 cell cycle checkpoint response complex that plays a critical role in DNA damage response and repair as well as maintaining genomic stability.

CEP41 is a centrosomal protein that plays a role in microtubule organization. It is implicated in ciliogenesis and may be involved in the Joubert syndrome, a disorder affecting the development of the cerebellum and brainstem.

2. DPP4, also known as CD26, is a serine exopeptidase that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. It is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism by inactivating incretins like GLP-1, and it also plays a role in immune regulation.

3. IQCG is associated with the regulation of the calcium channel activity in sperm. It is involved in sperm motility and may play a role in male fertility.

4. ITSN1 is an adaptor protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular signaling. It has a role in synaptic vesicle cycling and may influence neurotransmitter release.

5. NFATC4, or Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 4, is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to signals that increase intracellular calcium. It plays a role in the immune response and cardiac hypertrophy.

6. PDP1, Pyruvate dehyrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 1, is involved in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle.

7. PIP5K1C synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a precursor of secondary messengers involved in signaling pathways, including those regulating cell growth, shape, and motility.

8. PLCD1 encodes phospholipase C delta 1, which hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), involved in calcium signaling and protein kinase C activation.

9. RCAN3 is part of the regulators of calcineurin (RCAN) family and modulates calcineurin signaling. It is implicated in the negative feedback of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway.

10. SLU7 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and is essential for the generation of proper 3' splice site selection.

11. TRPV6 is a member of the transient receptor potential cation channel family and is involved in calcium absorption in the intestine and kidney.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling and ion homeostasis. CEP41, ITSN1, PIP5K1C, PLCD1, and NFATC4 are all involved in different aspects of cellular signaling pathways, with a focus on calcium signaling and its downstream effects, including gene expression and neurotransmitter release. DPP4 has a role in glucose metabolism and immune regulation. IQCG and TRPV6 are involved in calcium channel activity and homeostasis, with implications for fertility and mineral absorption, respectively. PDP1 connects metabolic pathways by regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. RCAN3 and SLU7, while not directly involved in signaling, modulate signaling pathways and RNA processing, respectively, which can indirectly affect cellular responses to signals.

The KRTAP (Keratin Associated Protein) family members, including KRTAP2-4, KRTAP4-4, KRTAP4-11, KRTAP5-3, KRTAP5-6, KRTAP9-8, KRTAP10-3, and KRTAP10-7, are a group of proteins that are associated with the keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. They contribute to the formation of the hair shaft by determining its shape and rigidity. These proteins are rich in cysteine, which allows for the formation of disulfide bonds, leading to the highly cross-linked and resilient structure of hair keratin.

2. The LCE (Late Cornified Envelope) proteins, including LCE3A, LCE3B, LCE3C, and LCE4A, are expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis. They are involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a structure that provides a barrier to protect against environmental stressors, pathogens, and water loss. The LCE proteins are thought to play a role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which is a critical process in maintaining skin integrity and function.

3. SSC4D (Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen Recognized by T Cells 4D) is less directly related to the structural components of hair and skin but may be involved in immune responses in the skin. It is a serine protease inhibitor that can be overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting a role in the regulation of protease activity during skin pathology.

To summarize, the majority of the genes in this set encode proteins that are directly involved in the structural integrity and formation of hair and the epidermal barrier.

The KRTAP (Keratin Associated Protein) family members, including KRTAP2-4, KRTAP4-4, KRTAP4-11, KRTAP5-3, KRTAP5-6, KRTAP9-8, KRTAP10-3, and KRTAP10-7, are a group of proteins that are associated with the keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. They contribute to the formation of the hair shaft by determining its shape and rigidity. These proteins are rich in cysteine, which allows for the formation of disulfide bonds, leading to the highly cross-linked and resilient structure of hair keratin.

2. The LCE (Late Cornified Envelope) proteins, including LCE3A, LCE3B, LCE3C, and LCE4A, are expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis. They are involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a structure that provides a barrier to protect against environmental stressors, pathogens, and water loss. The LCE proteins are thought to play a role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which is a critical process in maintaining skin integrity and function.[1][2][3]

3. SSC4D (Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen Recognized by T Cells 4D) is less directly related to the structural components of hair and skin but may be involved in immune responses in the skin. It is a serine protease inhibitor that can be overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting a role in the regulation of protease activity during skin pathology.

To summarize, the majority of the genes in this set encode proteins that are directly involved in the structural integrity and formation of hair and the epidermal barrier. They play crucial roles in keratinocyte differentiation and the establishment of the physical and protective properties of the skin and hair. The presence of SSC4D suggests a potential link to skin immune responses or pathology, but its role is less central to the primary process identified. The high confidence score reflects the strong thematic consistency among the KRTAP and LCE proteins in their contribution to keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal barrier formation.

LYST, or lysosomal trafficking regulator, is involved in the regulation of lysosomal size and morphology. It plays a role in the sorting and trafficking of endosomal cargo destined for lysosomes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organelle function.

2. NRDE2 is less characterized but is thought to be involved in nuclear RNAi and may play a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, potentially influencing the stability or localization of specific mRNA transcripts.

3. REN, also known as renin, is primarily involved in blood pressure control and electrolyte balance. It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is not directly related to endosomal sorting but may be affected by vesicular trafficking processes.

4. SNRPA1 is a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein that is part of the spliceosome complex. It is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a process that occurs in the nucleus and is not directly related to endosomal sorting.

5. SNX6, SNX7, and SNX12 are members of the sorting nexin family. These proteins are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, playing roles in the retromer complex, which is responsible for the retrograde transport of cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.

6. SORT1, or sortilin, functions in the sorting of proteins to the lysosomes. It is involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes and may also play a role in neurotrophic signaling and apoptosis.

7. TMEM9, TMEM123, and TMEM189 are transmembrane proteins with less well-characterized functions. However, transmembrane proteins often play roles in cellular transport and signaling, potentially contributing to the trafficking system.

8. WASHC3 is part of the WASH complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting and the regulation of actin polymerization. It plays a role in the fission of transport intermediates from the endosomes.

9. WDFY1 is a WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein that is implicated in endosomal sorting and signaling pathways, potentially acting as an adaptor in the endosomal system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in the processes of endosomal sorting and trafficking, which are essential for the proper distribution and degradation of cellular components. While not all proteins are directly linked to this process, the preponderance of sorting nexins and related proteins suggests a strong functional theme.

5. RNA processing and modification, with proteins like TSR2 (TSR2 ribosome maturation factor) and TRMT2B (tRNA methyltransferase 2 homolog B).

6. Membrane trafficking and endosomal sorting, roles associated with SNX14 (sorting nexin 14) and SNX16 (sorting nexin 16).[10][11][12]

7. Structural components of the cytoskeleton, such as RAPH1 (Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) and pleckstrin homology domains 1).[13][14][15]

8. Neurological functions, with SNCA (synuclein alpha) being implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.[16][17][18]

Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying theme in their functions, it is not possible to assign a single biological process that is prominently performed by this system. The proteins listed do not exhibit a clear synergistic or antagonistic relationship that would suggest a cohesive biological process. Therefore, the most accurate description for this group of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the absence of a predominant biological process among them.

ACVR1B (Activin A receptor type-1B), ACVR1C (Activin A receptor type-1C), and ACVR2A (Activin A receptor type-2A) are receptors that belong to the TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-beta) superfamily. These receptors are involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. They are serine/threonine kinase receptors that mediate the cellular responses to members of the TGF-β superfamily such as activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).

2. ARHGAP29 is a GTPase-activating protein that negatively regulates Rho GTPases, which are involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. Rho GTPases are also known to interact with TGF-β signaling, suggesting a potential modulatory role of ARHGAP29 in this pathway.

3. GDF11 (Growth Differentiation Factor 11) and NBL1 (neuroblastoma 1, DAN family BMP antagonist) are members of the TGF-β superfamily. GDF11 has been shown to regulate anterior-posterior patterning and to modulate aging and regeneration processes. NBL1 acts as an antagonist in the TGF-β signaling pathway, which can modulate the activity of TGF-β family ligands.

4. TWSG1 (Twisted gastrulation BMP signaling modulator 1) is another protein that modulates BMP signaling, a branch of the TGF-β pathway. It can either enhance or inhibit BMP signaling depending on the context and the presence of other interacting proteins.

5. The remaining proteins, such as C17orf53, C18orf54, CCDC28B, CERK, CLEC1A, CNGB1, DCAF17, DNAJC27, and SYNJ2BP, do not have well-established direct roles in the TGF-β signaling pathway based on the current knowledge. However, they may contribute to the broader regulatory network that influences TGF-β signaling indirectly or in a context-dependent manner.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly or indirectly involved in the modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for a wide range of cellular processes, and its precise regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The proteins ACVR1B, ACVR1C, ACVR2A, GDF11, NBL1, and TWSG1 have clear roles in this pathway, while others like ARHGAP29 may modulate it through their effects on Rho GTPases.

The proteins listed do not appear to converge on a single, prominent biological process. Instead, they are implicated in various cellular activities, ranging from developmental processes to signal transduction, ion transport, and enzymatic regulation. Here is a brief overview of the functional diversity within this system:

1. Proteins such as C1orf204, C17orf64, and KIAA0825 are poorly characterized, with limited information on their biological roles. Their inclusion does not suggest a common process.

2. CBLN2 is involved in synapse integrity and neuronal communication, while proteins like KCNJ13, KCNK5, and KCNT2 are potassium channels with roles in maintaining the membrane potential and regulating neuronal excitability.

3. GH1 (Growth Hormone 1) plays a critical role in growth, metabolism, and development, whereas GREM2 (Gremlin 2) is involved in developmental processes and antagonizes bone morphogenetic proteins.

4. GRPR (Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor) is a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including cell signaling in the gastrointestinal tract.

1. Transcription factors such as ARID5B and BHLHE41 are involved in gene expression regulation but do not share a common pathway or target gene set that would suggest a unified biological process.

2. Proteins like EDN2, EDNRA, and EDNRB are part of the endothelin system, which is involved in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation, but this system does not encompass the majority of the proteins listed.

3. IGF2, IGFBP5, and IGFBP6 are part of the insulin-like growth factor system, which plays a role in growth and development. However, this system is not the central theme for the entire set of proteins.

4. Proteins such as ITGA9 (an integrin) and TNS2 (tensin) are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, but again, these functions do not represent a unified process for the entire group.

5. Enzymes like H6PD and HDHD3 are involved in metabolic processes, but they do not define a singular metabolic pathway that is prominently represented by the protein set.

6. NTRK3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal differentiation, which is a distinct process not shared by the majority of the proteins listed.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, overarching biological process that is prominently represented by the majority of the proteins in the list, it is appropriate to conclude that this is a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00. This indicates that there is no single biological process that can be confidently named based on the provided protein system."	0.0	0	3/6	1.3653468916430484e-07	3.973159454681271e-05	EDNRA;EDN2;EDNRB	Vascular Associated Smooth Muscle Contraction (GO:0014829)	Vascular Associated Smooth Muscle Contraction 	GO:0014829	EDNRA EDN2 EDNRB EDN3 PIK3C2A SLC8A1	0.3346082	0.0714285714285714	False	False	"The provided list of proteins encompasses a wide array of functions and does not appear to converge on a single, prominent biological process.

DSG4, Desmoglein 4, is a component of desmosomes, which are cell-cell junctions between keratinocytes in the epidermis and hair follicles. Mutations in DSG4 are associated with hair growth disorders, indicating its role in hair follicle integrity and function.

2. GJA3, Gap Junction Protein Alpha 3, also known as Connexin46, is involved in intercellular communication in the lens of the eye and potentially in the skin. While its role in hair follicle development is less clear, gap junctions are known to be important in coordinating cellular functions during tissue differentiation.

3. HEPHL1, Hephaestin-like 1, is a copper-dependent ferroxidase involved in iron homeostasis. Its role in hair follicle development is not well characterized, but it may contribute to the pigmentation process, as copper is a cofactor for tyrosinase, an enzyme critical for melanin production.

4. HOXC13, Homeobox C13, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in hair shaft and nail development. It regulates the expression of hair keratin genes and is essential for the formation of hair shaft cuticle cells.

5. KRT37, KRT40, KRT73, KRT74, and KRT83 are all hair-specific keratins. Keratins are structural proteins that form the intermediate filament network in epithelial cells, providing mechanical support and protection. These hair-specific keratins are essential for the structure and integrity of the hair shaft.

6. KRTAP11-1, Keratin Associated Protein 11-1, is part of a family of proteins that associate with keratin intermediate filaments in hair fibers to provide structural stability and rigidity.

7. LY6G6D, Lymphocyte Antigen 6 Complex Locus G6D, is less characterized in the context of hair follicle development, but members of the LY6 family are known to play roles in cell signaling and immune responses.

8. OXCT1 and OXCT2, 3-oxoacid CoA-transferases 1 and 2, are enzymes involved in ketone body metabolism. Their direct role in hair follicle development is not evident, but they may contribute to the energy metabolism within the highly proliferative hair follicle cells.

9. PADI3, Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase 3, is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins by converting arginine residues to citrulline. PADI3 is crucial for hair shaft formation, and mutations can lead to hair structure abnormalities.

10. PSORS1C2, Psoriasis Susceptibility 1 Candidate 2, has a poorly understood role in hair follicle biology but is implicated in skin diseases like psoriasis, which can affect hair growth.

11. S100A3, S100 Calcium Binding Protein A3, is found in hair cuticles and may have a role in hair and skin barrier function.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in the structure and development of hair follicles and the keratinization process, which is the formation of the protective layer of keratin in hair and skin. The system includes structural proteins (keratins), regulatory proteins (transcription factors), and proteins involved in cell adhesion and communication, all of which are essential for the proper development and maintenance of hair follicles."	0.92	0	5/68	1.659311733556051e-09	2.4889676003340773e-08	KRT37;KRT74;KRT40;KRT73;KRT83	Intermediate Filament Organization (GO:0045109)	Intermediate Filament Organization 	GO:0045109	KRT1 KRT5 KRT4 KRT3 KRT2 KRT14 KRT9 KRT13 KLHL24 KRT12 KRT7 BFSP1 KRT10 DES BFSP2 KRT19 KRT17 KRT16 KRT15 VIM PKP2 PKP1 KRT25 KRT24 KRT23 KRT20 MTM1 KRT6A KRT33B DNAJB6 KRT28 KRT27 KRT33A KRT26 KRT6B LOC100653049 KRT72 DSP KRT71 KRT36 KRT35 KRT79 KRT34 KRT78 KRT77 GFAP KRT32 KRT76 KRT31 KRT75 KRT74 KRT73 KRT39 KRT38 KRT37 INA EPPK1 KRT83 KRT82 KRT81 KRT80 TCHH KRT86 KRT85 KRT40 KRT84 NEFL BBLN	0.5347457	0.0632911392405063	True	False	"1.

GYG1 and GYG2 are glycogenin proteins that serve as the core upon which glycogen synthase (GYS1) can begin glycogen synthesis. GYG1 and GYG2 are involved in the autoglucosylation that initiates glycogen granule formation, while GYS1 extends the glycogen molecule by adding glucose units.

2. PPP1R3C, PPP1R10, PPP1R11, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, and PPP1R37 are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1 is a major enzyme that dephosphorylates glycogen synthase, activating it for glycogen synthesis, and glycogen phosphorylase, inactivating it to stop glycogen breakdown. These regulatory subunits target PP1 to specific subcellular locations and modulate its activity towards specific substrates, including those involved in glycogen metabolism.

3. UGP2 encodes for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2, an enzyme that produces UDP-glucose, a direct precursor for glycogen synthesis. This links the protein to glycogen metabolism as well.

4. AATK, LMTK2, SH3RF2, and SHOC2 are involved in signal transduction pathways that can influence cell survival, apoptosis, and possibly metabolic processes, although their direct roles in glycogen metabolism are not as clear as the other proteins mentioned.

5. CLOCK is a core component of the circadian clock, which regulates rhythms in physiology and behavior, including glucose metabolism. It forms a heterodimer with BMAL1 and regulates the transcription of various clock-controlled genes.

6. CIPC, TOX4, and ZFYVE16 are associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms and may indirectly influence metabolic processes through the modulation of circadian-controlled genes.

7. CNST, CSRNP1, PEAK1, PHACTR1, PHACTR3, PPP1R10, TPRN, and ZFYVE9 are proteins with diverse functions, including roles in cytoskeletal organization, RNA splicing, and signal transduction. Their direct involvement in glycogen metabolism or circadian regulation is not well established based on current knowledge.

To summarize, a significant number of proteins in this system are directly involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, with a subset also linked to the circadian regulation of metabolic processes. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated regulation of glucose homeostasis that is influenced by the circadian clock, which could have implications for understanding diseases such as diabetes where both glycogen metabolism and circadian rhythms are disrupted.

The proteins listed are involved in various biochemical pathways and cellular functions, which include but are not limited to carbohydrate metabolism, lipid transport, cellular structure, and signal transduction. Here is a brief overview of the diversity of functions:

1. ACCS (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase) is involved in the synthesis of ethylene, a plant hormone, and is not typically associated with a specific human biological process.

2. AMY1B (amylase, alpha 1B) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into sugars, which is a part of carbohydrate digestion.

3. APOA5 (apolipoprotein A-V) plays an important role in lipid metabolism and is associated with the regulation of plasma triglyceride levels.

4. ARSI (arylsulfatase I) is involved in the breakdown of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, which are components of the extracellular matrix.

13. CYP3A43 (cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 43) is involved in drug metabolism and the synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids.

14. DGCR6 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 6) is implicated in the development of DiGeorge syndrome but its exact function is not well defined.

15. ENTPD3 and ENTPD8 (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases 3 and 8) are involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates.

16. EPB41L4A (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 4A) is involved in maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane.

17. FAR2 (fatty acyl-CoA reductase 2) is involved in fatty acid metabolism.

18. FLRT3 (fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein 3) is involved in cell adhesion and signaling.

19. GCNT3 (glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 3) is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans.

20. GPR68 (G protein-coupled receptor 68) is a proton-sensing receptor involved in various signaling pathways.

21. HAPLN4 (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 4) is involved in stabilizing the extracellular matrix.

22. MFSD2A (major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2A) is involved in the transport of lipids across the blood-brain barrier.

23. NAA60 (N-alpha-acetyltransferase 60) is involved in protein modification through N-terminal acetylation.

24. PDLIM2 (PDZ and LIM domain 2) is involved in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction.

25. The SULT1 family members (SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1A4, SULT1C2, SULT1C4) are sulfotransferases involved in the metabolism of hormones, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds.

The proteins ABHD13, APLF, APTX, CHD1L, GADD45G, H2AFY, H2AFY2, HPF1, LIG4, MACROD1, NHEJ1, NSUN6, PARP3, PGBD4, PURB, TTC5, XPC, and XRCC4 are involved in various aspects of DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. These proteins function in detecting DNA damage, signaling its presence, and facilitating repair through multiple pathways, including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and non-homologous end joining.

2. LIG4, XRCC4, and NHEJ1 are key components of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. LIG4 is a ligase that, together with XRCC4, seals the DNA ends, while NHEJ1 (also known as XLF) stabilizes the DNA ends for processing.

3. APTX, GADD45G, and PARP3 are associated with base excision repair (BER). APTX resolves DNA single-strand breaks, a common type of damage. GADD45G is involved in the recognition and signaling of DNA damage, while PARP3 is implicated in DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic stability.

4. XPC is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), recognizing and initiating the repair of helix-distorting DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV light.

5. CHD1L, H2AFY, and H2AFY2 are chromatin remodelers or histone variants that modulate the accessibility of DNA to repair proteins. CHD1L has ATPase activity and is implicated in the relaxation of chromatin structure during DNA repair.

6. Proteins such as CETN2 and HAP1, while not directly involved in DNA repair, may influence the process through their roles in cell cycle regulation and intracellular trafficking, respectively.

7. The proteins PURB and EHF are transcription factors that could potentially regulate the expression of genes involved in DNA repair or the cellular response to DNA damage.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into the cellular mechanisms for maintaining genomic integrity. They work in concert to detect, signal, and repair various types of DNA damage, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and preventing the accumulation of mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer. The system reflects a robust network of proteins that orchestrate the DNA damage response and repair processes, which are critical for cellular survival and the prevention of genomic instability."	0.92	2	3/5	1.3262488527423456e-08	5.658661771700675e-07	XRCC4;LIG4;NHEJ1	Immunoglobulin V(D)J Recombination (GO:0033152)	Immunoglobulin V	D	XRCC4 LIG4 PRKDC TCF3 NHEJ1	0.2142689	0.12	True	False	"1.

6. SMPDL3B, STAM, STAM2, and VAV2, VAV3 are involved in endosomal sorting and signaling. STAM and STAM2 are part of the ESCRT-0 complex, which is involved in the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation. VAV proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho family GTPases, which are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton.[13][14][15]

7. SYNJ2 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that plays a role in endocytosis and the recycling of synaptic vesicles, which is also linked to actin dynamics.[16][17]

8. UNC50 is involved in the Golgi-to-endosome transport and may play a role in the trafficking of proteins that are important for actin cytoskeleton regulation.

9. PEX13 is a component of the peroxisomal membrane and is involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. While not directly related to actin cytoskeleton or membrane trafficking, peroxisomes can interact with the cytoskeleton for positioning within the cell.[18][19][20]

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. These processes are essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling cell movement, and regulating the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins. The interplay between these proteins facilitates the dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton and the precise control of membrane protein localization, which is critical for cellular responsiveness to external signals.

Given the diversity of these proteins' functions, it is not possible to ascribe a single, overarching biological process to this system. The proteins do not appear to be functionally integrated into a common pathway or process that is readily discernible from the information provided. Therefore, the most accurate description of this system is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the lack of a unifying biological process among the proteins listed. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a prominent biological process within this system based on the current understanding of these proteins' roles.

It is involved in p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis triggered by various stimuli, including DNA damage and growth factor deprivation. BBC3 acts by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, neutralizing their protective effect and thus promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is a critical step in apoptosis.

2. PMAIP1, known as NOXA, is another pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Similar to BBC3, it is implicated in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is regulated by p53. PMAIP1 preferentially binds to MCL1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and targets it for proteasomal degradation, thereby tipping the balance towards apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

3. CC2D1A is a transcriptional co-regulator that has been implicated in neural development and is known to interact with the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A. While its direct role in apoptosis is less clear compared to BBC3 and PMAIP1, it has been associated with signaling pathways that can influence cell survival and apoptosis indirectly.

The proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. BBC3 and PMAIP1 are direct effectors of apoptosis, promoting cell death in response to stress signals.

BTBD2, CUL4B, DCAF6, DCAF10, DCAF11, DCAF16, RNF7, and ZER1 are components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). They are involved in the targeted degradation of proteins through ubiquitination, which is a post-translational modification where ubiquitin proteins are attached to a substrate protein, marking it for degradation by the proteasome. CUL4B is a core component of the cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which recruits substrates through specific adaptors such as DCAF proteins. RNF7 acts as a ring finger protein that can enhance the ubiquitination activity of the complex.

2. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that has a well-established role in the regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor, thus participating in cell cycle control and apoptosis. It can also be involved in the UPS through its ubiquitin ligase activity.

3. SENP3 is a SUMO-specific protease involved in the deSUMOylation process, which can indirectly affect ubiquitination pathways by altering the SUMOylation status of proteins that are also targets for ubiquitination.

4. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins and the stabilization of a number of client proteins, many of which are involved in signal transduction and protection against stress. It can interact with the UPS by stabilizing proteins before they are ubiquitinated or by refolding ubiquitinated proteins that have been targeted for degradation.

5. TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction. It can influence the UPS by promoting the degradation of IκB, leading to the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses.

6. UBXN1 and UBXN7 are members of the UBX domain-containing protein family, which can interact with the p97/VCP segregase, a protein involved in the extraction of ubiquitinated proteins from membranes or protein complexes in preparation for their degradation by the proteasome.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein quality control, regulation of cell cycle, and various signaling pathways. Additionally, they play roles in the cellular stress response, particularly in the context of protein folding and inflammation.

ARHGAP21 is a GTPase-activating protein that interacts with the small GTPase Cdc42, which is involved in various cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton organization, cell shape, and cell migration. ARHGAP21 has been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion and may indirectly influence gene expression by modulating the cytoskeleton and cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix.

2. CDC27 is a core component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a large E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates various stages of the cell cycle. The APC/C is crucial for the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis and the exit from mitosis into the G1 phase. It targets cell cycle regulators such as cyclins and securin for proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling cell cycle transitions.

3. CTNNA2 encodes alpha-catenin, a protein that links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton in adherens junctions, which are important for cell-cell adhesion. While its primary role is structural, it can also influence signaling pathways that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation.

4. HDAC1 is a histone deacetylase involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. By removing acetyl groups from histone tails, HDAC1 condenses chromatin structure, which generally suppresses gene expression. It can also deacetylate non-histone proteins, affecting their function and stability.

5. SOX2 is a transcription factor critical for maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. It regulates gene expression programs that are essential for self-renewal and can also influence cell fate decisions during development. SOX2 has been shown to interact with chromatin-modifying enzymes, including HDAC1, to regulate gene expression.

6. USP7, also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can remove ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby preventing their degradation by the proteasome. It has several substrates, including p53 and MDM2, which are key regulators of the cell cycle and apoptosis. USP7 can modulate chromatin structure indirectly through its regulation of histone ubiquitination.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression (HDAC1, SOX2), as well as the progression and regulation of the cell cycle (CDC27, USP7). ARHGAP21 and CTNNA2, while primarily associated with cytoskeletal and cell adhesion functions, can indirectly influence gene expression and cell proliferation. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated role in ensuring proper cell cycle progression and maintaining the integrity of gene expression programs, particularly in contexts where cell adhesion and chromatin structure are dynamically regulated."	0.85	22	1/5	0.0014992198216206	0.0250272381907666	USP7	Negative Regulation Of Gene Expression Via CpG Island Methylation (GO:0044027)	Negative Regulation Of Gene Expression Via CpG Island Methylation 	GO:0044027	HELLS USP7 UHRF2 UHRF1 ZNF445	0.31483042	0.1	True	False	"1.

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:

1. BAALC is associated with hematopoiesis and has been implicated in leukemia. It does not share a direct functional pathway with the majority of the other proteins listed.

2. HRH3 is a histamine receptor involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in the brain, which is functionally distinct from hematopoiesis or other processes listed.

3. IFNG is a cytokine critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumor control, diverging from the roles of neurotransmitter regulation or hematopoiesis.

4. KCNS2 is a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, which modulates electrical signaling in neurons, again differing from immune function or hematopoiesis.

5. LOXHD1 is involved in the functioning of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the hair cells in the ear, which is unrelated to the aforementioned processes.

6. MAB21L3, MADCAM1, MS4A4E, NPIPA3, NT5M, OIT3, PADI1, PNLDC1, PRRT4, SCTR, SHISA2, SIRPD, SLC30A3, SLC39A12, SLCO4C1, SPINK1, TBC1D26, TBX1, TLL2, TMC3, TMEM74B, TMEM233, ULK4, WISP3, and ZDHHC19 are all proteins with diverse roles ranging from development, cell signaling, ion transport, enzyme regulation, to protein modification. None of these functions suggest a unified biological process when considered collectively.

7. The lack of a clear functional theme or pathway that is shared among the majority of these proteins indicates that they do not form a coherent system dedicated to a specific biological process.

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:

1. BAALC is associated with hematopoiesis and has been implicated in leukemia. It does not share a direct functional pathway with the majority of the other proteins listed.[1][2][3]

2. HRH3 is a histamine receptor involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in the brain, which is functionally distinct from hematopoiesis or other processes listed.[4][5][6]

3. IFNG is a cytokine critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumor control, diverging from the roles of neurotransmitter regulation or hematopoiesis.[7][8][9]

4. KCNS2 is a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, which modulates electrical signaling in neurons, again differing from immune function or hematopoiesis.

5. LOXHD1 is involved in the functioning of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the hair cells in the ear, which is unrelated to the aforementioned processes.[10][11][12]

6. MAB21L3, MADCAM1, MS4A4E, NPIPA3, NT5M, OIT3, PADI1, PNLDC1, PRRT4, SCTR, SHISA2, SIRPD, SLC30A3, SLC39A12, SLCO4C1, SPINK1, TBC1D26, TBX1, TLL2, TMC3, TMEM74B, TMEM233, ULK4, WISP3, and ZDHHC19 are all proteins with diverse roles ranging from development, cell signaling, ion transport, enzyme regulation, to protein modification. None of these functions suggest a unified biological process when considered collectively.[13][14][15]

7. The lack of a clear functional theme or pathway that is shared among the majority of these proteins indicates that they do not form a coherent system dedicated to a specific biological process.

In conclusion, the proteins listed do not exhibit a significant degree of functional integration or interplay that would suggest a common biological process. Therefore, the most appropriate designation for this group of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the absence of a unifying biological process among them.

ATF1, ATF4, CREB1, and CREM are members of the Activating Transcription Factor (ATF)/cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB) protein family. These transcription factors can form homo- or heterodimers and bind to cAMP response elements (CRE) in DNA, regulating the transcription of genes in response to hormonal and stress signals. ATF4 is particularly known for its role in the cellular stress response, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), and amino acid metabolism.

2. BATF and JDP2 are basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. BATF forms dimers with Jun proteins and is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and differentiation of immune cells. JDP2 represses transcription by forming inactive complexes with other transcription factors and is implicated in cellular stress response mechanisms.

3. CEBPG (also known as C/EBP gamma) is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and functions as a transcriptional regulator involved in cell cycle and metabolism. It can act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of other C/EBP family members.

4. DDIT3 (also known as CHOP) is a transcription factor induced by cellular stress, particularly during the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. It is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and can heterodimerize with ATF4.

5. GABBR1 and GABBR2 encode the subunits of the GABA(B) receptor, which is involved in neurotransmission. While not directly related to transcriptional regulation, their interaction with the system could suggest a role in cellular signaling pathways that influence gene expression.

6. GOLGA1 (also known as golgin A1) is involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and may play a role in the trafficking of proteins that are crucial for transcriptional regulation.

7. JAKMIP1 (Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1) is associated with microtubules and may be involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene expression.

8. MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein) is a transcription factor that can bind to G/C-rich DNA sequences and is implicated in gene expression regulation and DNA repair.

9. POU6F1 (POU class 6 homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that may play a role in the development of the nervous system and in the regulation of gene expression.

10. UTF1 (Undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1) is associated with maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and may regulate gene expression during early development.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to cellular stress and developmental signals. They include transcription factors that respond to stress, regulate metabolism, and control developmental processes.

CDCA5 (Sororin) plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion during the S phase of the cell cycle, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. It interacts with cohesin complexes to maintain cohesion between sister chromatids after DNA replication.

2. DNMT1 is the primary enzyme responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns following DNA replication. It ensures the proper hereditary transmission of epigenetic information, which is critical for gene expression regulation and genome stability.

3. FANCD2 is a key component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks that otherwise could lead to chromosomal instability. It is monoubiquitinated and recruited to sites of DNA damage, promoting repair and maintaining genomic integrity.

4. KIFC1 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a role in chromosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis. It is also implicated in the transport of vesicles and organelles, which can indirectly affect DNA replication and repair processes.

5. ORC1 is a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that is essential for the initiation of DNA replication. It binds to replication origins and participates in the formation of pre-replicative complexes, ensuring that DNA replication starts at the correct sites and time.

6. POLH is a DNA polymerase involved in translesion synthesis, allowing DNA replication to continue past sites of damage. It helps maintain genetic stability by preventing stalling of the replication machinery at damaged sites.

7. RAD18 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in post-replication repair by monoubiquitinating PCNA, which is involved in DNA replication and repair. This modification allows recruitment of translesion synthesis polymerases to bypass DNA lesions.

8. REV3L is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, which is involved in translesion synthesis. It facilitates DNA synthesis past DNA lesions that would otherwise block replicative polymerases, contributing to DNA damage tolerance.

9. RFC4 is part of the replication factor C complex, which is involved in loading the sliding clamp PCNA onto DNA. This is essential for high-fidelity DNA replication and is also involved in DNA repair processes.

10. RPA1 is a subunit of the replication protein A complex, which stabilizes single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication and repair. It is essential for various DNA metabolic processes, including replication, recombination, and repair.

11. SMC2 is a core subunit of the condensin complex, which is crucial for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. Proper chromosome condensation is necessary to prevent DNA damage during cell division.

12. TERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which adds telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes, compensating for the loss of DNA that occurs during replication. It is essential for maintaining telomere length and genomic stability.

13. TIMELESS is involved in DNA replication checkpoint control and interacts with TIPIN to form a complex that stabilizes replication forks, ensuring proper DNA replication under stress conditions.

14. TNF is a cytokine that can induce a wide range of intracellular signaling pathways, including apoptosis and inflammation. While not directly involved in DNA replication or repair, it can influence these processes through its role in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage.

15. USP7 (HAUSP) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the stability of proteins by removing ubiquitin chains. It is involved in the DNA damage response by stabilizing p53 and can also regulate the Fanconi anemia pathway by deubiquitinating FANCD2.

CDCA5 (Sororin) plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion during the S phase of the cell cycle, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. It interacts with cohesin complexes to maintain cohesion between sister chromatids after DNA replication.[1][2][3]

2. DNMT1 is the primary enzyme responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns following DNA replication. It ensures the proper hereditary transmission of epigenetic information, which is critical for gene expression regulation and genome stability.[4][5][6]

3. FANCD2 is a key component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks that otherwise could lead to chromosomal instability. It is monoubiquitinated and recruited to sites of DNA damage, promoting repair and maintaining genomic integrity.[7][8][9]

4. KIFC1 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a role in chromosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis. It is also implicated in the transport of vesicles and organelles, which can indirectly affect DNA replication and repair processes.[10][11][12]

5. ORC1 is a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that is essential for the initiation of DNA replication. It binds to replication origins and participates in the formation of pre-replicative complexes, ensuring that DNA replication starts at the correct sites and time.[13][14][15]

6. POLH is a DNA polymerase involved in translesion synthesis, allowing DNA replication to continue past sites of damage. It helps maintain genetic stability by preventing stalling of the replication machinery at damaged sites.[16][17][18]

7. RAD18 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in post-replication repair by monoubiquitinating PCNA, which is involved in DNA replication and repair. This modification allows recruitment of translesion synthesis polymerases to bypass DNA lesions.[19][20][21]

8. REV3L is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, which is involved in translesion synthesis. It facilitates DNA synthesis past DNA lesions that would otherwise block replicative polymerases, contributing to DNA damage tolerance.[22][23][24]

9. RFC4 is part of the replication factor C complex, which is involved in loading the sliding clamp PCNA onto DNA. This is essential for high-fidelity DNA replication and is also involved in DNA repair processes.[25][26][27]

10. RPA1 is a subunit of the replication protein A complex, which stabilizes single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication and repair. It is essential for various DNA metabolic processes, including replication, recombination, and repair.[28][29][30]

11. SMC2 is a core subunit of the condensin complex, which is crucial for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. Proper chromosome condensation is necessary to prevent DNA damage during cell division.[31][32][33]

12. TERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which adds telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes, compensating for the loss of DNA that occurs during replication. It is essential for maintaining telomere length and genomic stability.[34][35][36]

13. TIMELESS is involved in DNA replication checkpoint control and interacts with TIPIN to form a complex that stabilizes replication forks, ensuring proper DNA replication under stress conditions.[37][38][39]

14. TNF is a cytokine that can induce a wide range of intracellular signaling pathways, including apoptosis and inflammation. While not directly involved in DNA replication or repair, it can influence these processes through its role in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage.

15. USP7 (HAUSP) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the stability of proteins by removing ubiquitin chains. It is involved in the DNA damage response by stabilizing p53 and can also regulate the Fanconi anemia pathway by deubiquitinating FANCD2.[40][41][42]

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication and repair. They work in concert to maintain genomic stability by facilitating accurate DNA replication, resolving replication stress, repairing DNA damage, and ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. The interplay between these proteins is critical for the prevention of genomic instability, which can lead to cancer and other diseases.

It plays a role in the assembly of the transcription complex and recruitment of RNA polymerase III to gene promoters.

2. MSI2 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation and stability of target mRNAs. It is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation and maintenance of stem cell populations.

3. PABPC1 and PABPC4 are poly(A) binding proteins that bind to the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules, thereby contributing to the regulation of translation initiation, mRNA stability, and polyadenylation. They play a role in the control of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.

4. PAPOLG is a poly(A) polymerase that adds a poly(A) tail to the 3' end of RNA molecules, which is important for mRNA stability and efficient translation. It is involved in the maturation of pre-mRNA into functional mRNA.

5. PPP1CC is a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1, which is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes through dephosphorylation of target proteins. It can influence various aspects of mRNA metabolism and translation through its effects on protein phosphorylation.

6. RANGAP1 is a GTPase-activating protein for RAN, a small GTP-binding protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. It plays a role in the transport of RNA and proteins across the nuclear envelope, which is essential for gene expression regulation.

7. RPL4 is a component of the ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis. Ribosomes translate mRNA into polypeptide chains, thus playing a central role in gene expression.

8. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is involved in the maintenance of telomere length, which is not directly related to gene expression but is crucial for chromosome stability and cellular lifespan, indirectly affecting gene expression patterns over time.

9. WWOX is a tumor suppressor protein that can interact with various transcription factors and modulate their activity. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in RNA processing.

10. ZC3H3 is a zinc finger protein that is thought to be involved in mRNA processing, particularly in mRNA export from the nucleus.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in various stages of gene expression, including transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA stability, translation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. While TERT is more indirectly related through its role in telomere maintenance, the other proteins contribute more directly to the regulation of gene expression and mRNA stability.

ACER3 (Alkaline Ceramidase 3) is involved in the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine, a process that occurs at an alkaline pH. This reaction is part of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.

2. CERS2 (Ceramide Synthase 2), CERS4 (Ceramide Synthase 4), CERS5 (Ceramide Synthase 5), and CERS6 (Ceramide Synthase 6) are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of ceramides. They catalyze the formation of ceramide from sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoA, which is a central step in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Each of these enzymes has specificity for acyl-CoA of different chain lengths, contributing to the diversity of ceramide species in membranes.

3. FA2H (Fatty Acid 2-Hydroxylase) is involved in the hydroxylation of sphingolipid and fatty acid components of myelin. This modification is important for the stability and function of myelin sheaths in the nervous system.

4. PFDN2 (Prefoldin Subunit 2) is part of the prefoldin complex, which is involved in the folding of proteins upon their synthesis. While not directly related to sphingolipid metabolism, proper protein folding is essential for the function of all enzymes, including those involved in lipid metabolism.

5. SLC36A1 (Solute Carrier Family 36 Member 1) is a proton-coupled amino acid transporter. Although not directly involved in sphingolipid metabolism, amino acid transport can be linked to overall cellular homeostasis and may indirectly affect the metabolism of sphingolipids through regulation of cellular growth and protein synthesis.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in the synthesis and degradation of sphingolipids, which are essential components of cell membranes and play a significant role in signaling pathways. The presence of PFDN2 suggests a general role in protein homeostasis, which is necessary for the proper function of all cellular processes, including lipid metabolism.

ACTB and ACTG1 are both cytoskeletal proteins that form the microfilament system of the cytoskeleton. They are involved in providing structural support, enabling cell motility, and are implicated in various cellular processes such as cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, and the establishment of cell junctions.

2. TUBB3 is a class III beta-tubulin, a component of microtubules, which are part of the cytoskeleton and play critical roles in maintaining cell shape, intracellular transport, and cell division. TUBB3 is particularly important in neurons and is involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system.

3. MAPRE1, also known as EB1, is a microtubule-associated protein that interacts with the plus ends of microtubules and is involved in microtubule dynamics, mitosis, and cell migration. It also plays a role in anchoring microtubules to centrosomes and other microtubule-organizing centers.

4. CKAP5, also known as ch-TOG or XMAP215, is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and is involved in spindle formation during mitosis. It is essential for proper chromosome segregation and cell division.

5. ATP6V1B2 is a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, an essential process for intracellular trafficking, protein degradation, and organelle function.

6. PSMD1 is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, which is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The proteasome plays a pivotal role in maintaining protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular function.

7. HDAC6 is a histone deacetylase that has a broader substrate specificity and is involved in the deacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tubulin. It is implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and also plays a role in cellular stress responses by coordinating the aggresome pathway, which sequesters misfolded proteins.

8. HSPA1B is a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, which acts as molecular chaperones facilitating the folding of newly synthesized proteins, the refolding of misfolded proteins, and the degradation of proteins that can no longer be salvaged. It is also involved in protecting cells from stress.

9. EEF1A1 is an elongation factor that plays a central role in the elongation step during protein synthesis by the ribosome. It is also known to interact with actin and the cytoskeleton and has been implicated in various non-canonical functions, including apoptosis and the cellular stress response.

10. TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction. It is also involved in the regulation of immune cells and can induce apoptotic cell death, inflammation, and inhibit tumorigenesis.

11. EML1 is a microtubule-associated protein that contributes to the stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton and is involved in cell division and the proper formation of the mitotic spindle.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the dynamics of the cytoskeleton and the cellular stress response. The cytoskeletal proteins (ACTB, ACTG1, TUBB3, MAPRE1, CKAP5, EEF1A1, EML1) are crucial for maintaining cell structure, division, and intracellular transport. The stress response proteins (HDAC6, HSPA1B, PSMD1, TNF) are essential for protein homeostasis, cellular recovery from stress, and the immune response. The system reflects a functional integration of cytoskeletal organization and cellular stress mechanisms, which are critical for cell survival and adaptation to environmental challenges."	0.85	1	2/8	9.221402746009655e-06	0.0016439441916583	TNF;HDAC6	Negative Regulation Of Protein-Containing Complex Disassembly (GO:0043242)	Negative Regulation Of Protein-Containing Complex Disassembly 	GO:0043242	HDAC6 RUBCN IRAK3 SLN PHF23 TMEM39A TNF UBQLN4	0.26447275	0.1111111111111111	True	False	"1.

GYG1 (Glycogenin-1) and GYS1 (Glycogen Synthase 1) are directly involved in glycogen synthesis. GYG1 acts as a primer for glycogen synthesis, initiating the core structure to which glucose residues are added. GYS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, responsible for the elongation of the glycogen chain by adding glucose units.

2. PPP1R3B (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3B) and PPP1R3C (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3C) are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase, thus promoting glycogen synthesis. PPP1R3B is known to be specific for the liver and PPP1R3C for skeletal muscle, indicating tissue-specific regulation of glycogen metabolism.

3. PPP1R11 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Inhibitor Subunit 11) and PPP1R37 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 37) are also associated with PP1, but their precise roles in glycogen metabolism are less clear. They may modulate the activity of PP1 in different contexts, potentially influencing glycogen storage or mobilization.

4. AATK (Apoptosis-Associated Tyrosine Kinase) and LMTK2 (Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2) are kinases that could be involved in signaling pathways that indirectly affect glycogen metabolism, although their direct roles in this process are not well established.

5. SNCAIP (Synuclein Alpha Interacting Protein) has been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and may have indirect effects on glycogen metabolism through neuronal signaling pathways.

6. The remaining proteins, such as C2orf74, C20orf27, CBARP, CCDC85B, CNST, CSRNP1, CSRNP2, ERBIN, NHLRC1, NNAT, PHACTR3, and the ZFYVE family members, do not have well-established roles in glycogen metabolism. Their inclusion in this analysis is based on less direct evidence or potential regulatory interactions that have yet to be fully characterized.

In summary, the primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of glycogen metabolism, with a focus on glycogen synthesis. The system includes key enzymes directly responsible for glycogen synthesis, regulatory subunits that modulate the activity of these enzymes, and additional proteins that may influence glycogen metabolism through signaling pathways or indirect interactions. The confidence score reflects the fact that while several proteins in the system are directly involved in glycogen metabolism, others have less clear roles or are involved in broader regulatory functions that may only peripherally impact this process."	0.85	0	4/9	1.377638336905611e-10	8.472475771969507e-09	GYS1;PPP1R3C;NHLRC1;GYG1	Glucan Biosynthetic Process (GO:0009250)	Glucan Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0009250	GYS2 PER2 UGP2 PPP1R3C NR1D1 NHLRC1 GYG1 GYG2 GYS1	0.49767905	0.1481481481481481	True	False	"1.

ACVR2A and ACVR2B are receptors for the TGF-beta superfamily of ligands. They are involved in a variety of processes including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. These receptors are part of the SMAD pathway, which is a canonical signaling route for TGF-beta ligands and is critical for transmitting extracellular signals to the nucleus.

2. AHSA1, CDC37L1, CHORDC1, HGH1, HSPA4, and TOMM34 are proteins associated with the molecular chaperone machinery. HSPA4 is a heat shock protein that assists in protein folding and protects cells from stress. AHSA1 acts as a co-chaperone that interacts with HSP90, affecting its chaperone activity. CDC37L1 and CHORDC1 are also co-chaperones that interact with HSP90, playing roles in protein folding and stabilization of specific client proteins. HGH1 is involved in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. TOMM34 is a co-chaperone that assists in the translocation of preproteins into mitochondria.

3. ARAF and RAF1 are part of the RAF kinase family, which plays a role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cellular growth, and survival. LRRK2 is a kinase associated with several signaling pathways, including those regulating neurite outgrowth and cell proliferation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in two main biological processes: signal transduction, particularly through the TGF-beta/SMAD and MAPK/ERK pathways, and protein folding, with a focus on the HSP90 chaperone system and its co-chaperones. These processes are crucial for proper cellular function and response to environmental stress.

These proteins have diverse functions and are involved in various biological processes, which makes it challenging to identify a single prominent biological process that they collectively perform.

1. ABLIM3, actin-binding LIM protein 3, is involved in cytoskeletal organization and may play a role in actin dynamics.

2. ARID5A, AT-rich interaction domain 5A, is a transcriptional regulator that may influence the expression of other genes.

3. CITED1, Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 1, functions as a transcriptional co-activator.

4. EFHD1, EF-hand domain-containing protein 1, is associated with calcium binding and may have a role in apoptosis.

5. ISL2, insulin gene enhancer protein ISL-2, is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation.

6. KIAA1671 is a protein with no well-characterized function.

7. KRT7, keratin 7, is a type II keratin involved in the structural integrity of epithelial cells.

8. LMO1, LIM domain only 1, is a transcriptional regulator that may play a role in neurogenesis.

9. LOXL4, lysyl oxidase-like 4, is involved in the crosslinking of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix.

10. MGMT, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, is involved in DNA repair by removing alkylating adducts from the O6 position of guanine.

11. MISP, mitotic spindle positioning, is involved in cell division and the proper orientation of the mitotic spindle.

12. NHLH1, nescient helix-loop-helix 1, is a transcription factor that may be involved in neuroendocrine differentiation.

13. PPARGC1B, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta, is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis.

14. RLIM, ring finger protein, LIM domain interacting, is a ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation.

15. SCIN, scinderin, is an actin-severing protein involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics.

16. SSBP4, single-stranded DNA-binding protein 4, may be involved in mitochondrial DNA stabilization and repair.

17. TAL1, T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1, is a transcription factor implicated in hematopoiesis and angiogenesis.

18. TUBB1, tubulin beta-1 chain, is a structural component of microtubules, essential for cell division and intracellular transport.

ALDOA (Aldolase A) and ALDOC (Aldolase C) are enzymes that catalyze the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, key steps in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. ALDOA is predominantly expressed in muscle tissue, while ALDOC is found in the brain.

2. EEF1A2 is a protein translation elongation factor that is primarily involved in the delivery of aminoacyl tRNAs to the ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and has also been implicated in actin bundling and cytoskeletal rearrangements.

3. GAPDHS (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, spermatogenic) is an isoenzyme of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH, which catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis, converting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. GAPDHS is specifically expressed in male germ cells.

4. GPI (Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate, an important step in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

5. ISYNA1 (Inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1) is involved in the synthesis of inositol, a precursor for inositol triphosphate (IP3), which is a second messenger molecule involved in various signaling pathways, including those that may intersect with glucose metabolism.

6. LDHA (Lactate dehydrogenase A), LDHB (Lactate dehydrogenase B), and LDHC (Lactate dehydrogenase C) are isoenzymes that catalyze the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+. LDHA is typically found in muscle tissue, LDHB is ubiquitously expressed, and LDHC is specific to the testis.

7. MPI (Mannose-6-phosphate isomerase) is involved in the interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate and plays a role in glycoprotein synthesis.

8. PGAM1 (Phosphoglycerate mutase 1) and PGAM4 (Phosphoglycerate mutase family member 4) catalyze the reversible conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

9. PGD (Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates NADPH and pentoses (5-carbon sugars) as well as ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides.

10. TALDO1 (Transaldolase 1) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that catalyzes the transfer of three-carbon units and is important for the interconnection between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, with additional roles in the pentose phosphate pathway and protein synthesis. These processes are tightly coordinated to maintain energy homeostasis and are essential for the production of ATP, the universal energy currency of the cell, as well as for the generation of precursors for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis. The interplay between these enzymes ensures a balance between energy production, consumption, and the biosynthetic needs of the cell."	0.92	1	6/29	1.5926069586795263e-14	6.768579574387985e-13	GPI;LDHA;PGAM1;GAPDHS;PGAM4;ALDOC	Glycolytic Process (GO:0006096)	Glycolytic Process 	GO:0006096	TPI1 PGAM1 PKLR PGAM2 GCK PKM PFKM PFKL HKDC1 PGAM4 GAPDHS ALDOC ALDOB GAPDH GPI PFKFB1 PFKFB2 UCP2 ENO1 ENO2 ENO3 HK1 ENO4 HK3 HK2 LDHA PGK2 PGK1 PGM1	0.65821326	0.1621621621621621	True	False	"1.

ATF3 and ATF4 are members of the Activating Transcription Factor family, which are involved in cellular stress responses. ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene that can be activated by a variety of stress signals, while ATF4 is a key player in the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) and regulates genes involved in amino acid metabolism, redox homeostasis, and the cellular response to hypoxia.

2. BRCA1, CHEK1, TP53, and PARP1 are central to the DNA damage response (DDR). BRCA1 is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. CHEK1 is a checkpoint kinase that mediates cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. TP53, or p53, is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. PARP1 is involved in the repair of single-strand breaks and also modulates chromatin structure to facilitate DDR.

3. CHD3, HDAC1, KAT2B, KAT5, MTA2, SIN3A, SIRT1, and SMARCA4 are chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers. They regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure, which is crucial for DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and other cellular processes. HDAC1 is involved in histone deacetylation, which can lead to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. KAT2B and KAT5 are histone acetyltransferases that play roles in transcriptional activation. SIRT1 is a deacetylase that modulates stress responses and aging.

4. CREB1, EP300, NFATC1, and NFATC2 are transcription factors and coactivators that regulate gene expression in response to various stimuli. CREB1 is activated by cAMP and regulates genes involved in cell survival and proliferation. EP300 is a histone acetyltransferase that acts as a transcriptional coactivator for numerous transcription factors, including p53.

5. JUN is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex and is involved in the regulation of genes in response to stress and growth signals.

6. MDM2, UBC, and UBE2I are involved in protein ubiquitination and degradation. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation, while UBC and UBE2I are involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

7. PML and SATB1 are involved in nuclear architecture and the regulation of gene expression. PML is a component of nuclear bodies and is implicated in the regulation of p53, while SATB1 is a global chromatin organizer and gene regulator.

Several proteins in this system, such as EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), MET (also known as HGFR, Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor), and their respective ligands, HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor) and EGF, are key components of signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, survival, proliferation, and differentiation. EGFR and MET are receptor tyrosine kinases that, upon ligand binding, undergo dimerization and autophosphorylation, initiating a cascade of downstream signaling events.

2. Adaptor proteins like SHC2 and SHC4 are involved in linking activated receptors to downstream signaling pathways by providing docking sites for other signaling molecules. These proteins typically contain SH2 domains that bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated receptors, facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes.

3. Proteins such as ANKS1A, LRIG1, and TNS3 are implicated in the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. LRIG1, for example, is known to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of activated receptors, thereby attenuating the signal.

4. IGFBP2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2) modulates the activity of insulin-like growth factors which are crucial for cellular growth and development. It binds to IGFs with high affinity and regulates their interaction with IGF receptors.

5. The SLC12 family members, SLC12A4, SLC12A6, and SLC12A7, are cation-chloride cotransporters involved in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis, which is essential for cell volume regulation and indirectly influences cell proliferation and migration.

6. Proteins like CKMT1B (Creatine Kinase, Mitochondrial 1B) are involved in cellular energy metabolism, which is closely linked to growth signaling pathways. Creatine kinase plays a role in the buffering and transport of high-energy phosphates within cells, which is critical for sustaining the energy demands of growth and proliferation.

7. UROD (Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase) is an enzyme involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Heme is an essential cofactor for various proteins, including those involved in oxygen transport and energy metabolism, indirectly supporting cellular growth and proliferation.

8. FER is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that can modulate signaling pathways related to cell adhesion, migration, and growth. It often acts downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and is involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the regulation of cellular growth and signal transduction. They include growth factor receptors, their ligands, adaptor proteins, and negative regulators that together form a complex network controlling cellular responses to external and internal stimuli.

4. WNT7A is a ligand for the frizzled receptors and plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway, affecting cell fate and patterning during development.[7][8][9]

The lack of a unifying biological process among these proteins suggests that they do not form a coherent system dedicated to a single biological function. Instead, they represent a collection of proteins with diverse roles across multiple cellular processes. Therefore, the most accurate description of this system is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the absence of a predominant biological process. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in naming a single, prominent biological process for this group of proteins.

CLOCK is a core component of the circadian clock, a transcription factor that forms a heterodimer with BMAL1 and regulates the expression of many genes, including those involved in the control of the circadian rhythm. It is essential for the generation of circadian rhythms and has been implicated in various physiological processes, including metabolism, DNA repair, and the immune response.

2. LMTK2, or lemur tyrosine kinase 2, is involved in intracellular signaling pathways and has been associated with the regulation of neuronal function and possibly the modulation of circadian rhythms through its interactions with other proteins.

3. PPP1R11 (inhibitor-3 of protein phosphatase 1) and PPP1R13L (apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2) are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively. These phosphatases are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of the cell cycle, cell growth, and apoptosis. They can also modulate the activity of proteins involved in the circadian rhythm.

4. PPP2R1A is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a major serine/threonine phosphatase implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. It has a role in the regulation of various signaling pathways and may influence circadian rhythm through dephosphorylation of key components.

5. SHOC2 is a scaffold protein that modulates the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It may indirectly affect circadian rhythm by influencing cellular processes that are time-dependent.

6. SMARCB1 is part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation of genes crucial for cell cycle progression and differentiation. It may play a role in the regulation of genes that are under circadian control.

7. TNF, or tumor necrosis factor, is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and the acute phase response. It can influence circadian rhythm by affecting sleep patterns and has been shown to alter the expression of clock genes.

8. TPRN is less characterized, but it is thought to be involved in cellular processes related to cytoskeletal organization. Its connection to circadian rhythm or stress response is not well established.

9. ZFYVE16, also known as endofin, is involved in endosomal trafficking. It may play a role in the regulation of signaling pathways that intersect with circadian rhythm regulation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm through transcriptional control, post-translational modifications, and signal transduction pathways. Additionally, some of these proteins are implicated in the cellular response to stress, which can influence or be influenced by the circadian clock.

The proteins listed are predominantly involved in mitochondrial function, including mitochondrial biogenesis, respiratory chain activity, and mitochondrial translation. These processes are critical for cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation.

2. TFAM, TFB2M, and MRPL36 are directly involved in mitochondrial DNA maintenance and expression. TFAM is a key activator of mitochondrial transcription, while TFB2M is part of the mitochondrial transcription machinery. MRPL36 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, essential for protein synthesis within the organelle.

3. Proteins such as ACO2, MDH2, and ATP5G3 are integral to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ATP synthesis.

ICE1 (Interactor of little elongation complex ELL subunit 1) and ICE2 are components of the Little Elongation Complex (LEC) which is involved in the regulation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene transcription. They interact with the transcription machinery to modulate transcription elongation and are implicated in the control of gene expression.

2. MED26 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a multiprotein complex that functions as a transcriptional coactivator in all eukaryotes. It is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and bridges the transcriptional regulators bound to enhancers and the core transcription machinery at promoters.

3. MLLT6 (Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to, 6) and MLLT10 (Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to, 10) are components of super elongation complexes (SECs) that are associated with chromatin modification and transcriptional elongation. They are known to be involved in hematopoiesis and may play a role in leukemogenesis.

4. TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is one of the cytokines that make up the acute phase reaction. It is produced chiefly by activated macrophages, although it can be produced by other cell types as well. TNF's primary role is in the regulation of immune cells, but it can also induce apoptotic cell death, inflammation, and inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of transcription and the inflammatory response. ICE1, ICE2, MED26, MLLT6, and MLLT10 are all associated with transcriptional regulation, either through the modulation of elongation or the bridging of transcriptional regulators to the core transcription machinery. TNF, while not directly involved in transcription, plays a significant role in the inflammatory response, which can be influenced by transcriptional regulation. The interplay between these proteins suggests a system that integrates transcriptional regulation with the cellular response to inflammation."	0.85	0	2/7	1.5738947571499835e-06	0.0004454122162734	ICE1;ICE2	snRNA Transcription By RNA Polymerase III (GO:0042796)	snRNA Transcription By RNA Polymerase III 	GO:0042796	ICE2 SNAPC3 SNAPC4 ICE1 SNAPC5 ZC3H8 SNAPC1	0.35080427	0.1818181818181818	True	False	"1.

BEGAIN (Brain-enriched guanylate kinase-associated) is a protein that is predominantly expressed in the brain and is thought to be involved in synaptic function and neuronal signaling. It interacts with guanylate kinase-associated proteins and may play a role in the molecular organization of synapses and in neuronal cell signaling.

2. CDR2L (Cerebellar degeneration-related protein 2-like) is known to be an antigen that is recognized by autoantibodies in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. It is expressed in the cerebellum and may have a role in the normal functioning of the cerebellum and in the pathogenesis of paraneoplastic neurological disorders.

3. DIRAS1 (DIRAS family GTPase 1) is a member of the small GTP-binding protein family and is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It has tumor suppressor-like activity and is implicated in the control of cell proliferation and potentially in cellular senescence.

4. FAM13C (Family with sequence similarity 13 member C) is a protein with unclear function, but it is thought to be involved in cell signaling pathways. It may have roles in cellular processes such as cell growth or apoptosis, but specific functions are not well characterized.

5. HID1 (Highly divergent homeobox) is a protein that is not well understood but is believed to be involved in intracellular trafficking or signaling. It may have a role in the regulation of vesicle-mediated transport or in the modulation of signaling pathways within cells.

6. RPS19 (Ribosomal protein S19) is a component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome and is involved in protein synthesis. Mutations in RPS19 are associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a disorder characterized by a failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells.

7. SPTBN2 (Spectrin beta chain, brain 2) is a protein that is part of the cytoskeletal spectrin-actin network and is important for the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity and cytoskeletal organization. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in the establishment of cell polarity and in the organization of membrane domains.

To summarize, the proteins listed do not appear to have a unifying biological process that they predominantly contribute to.

ACAA1 (Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1) and ACOX1 (Acyl-CoA oxidase 1) are key enzymes in the beta-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids within peroxisomes. ACAA1 catalyzes the last step of the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, while ACOX1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step.

2. C6orf226 is a less characterized protein, but its association with peroxisomal proteins suggests a role in peroxisomal function or biogenesis.

3. CAT (Catalase) is a peroxisomal marker enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of fatty acid beta-oxidation, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage.

4. DDO (D-aspartate oxidase) and DECR2 (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 2) are involved in the catabolism of D-amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids, respectively, processes that occur within peroxisomes.

5. HSD17B4 (Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4) is a multifunctional enzyme that also participates in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation.

6. PEX5L (Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5-like), PEX6, PEX16, and PEX26 are all members of the peroxins family, which are proteins involved in the biogenesis and maintenance of peroxisomes. PEX5L is a variant of PEX5 and is involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. PEX6, PEX16, and PEX26 are involved in the assembly of the peroxisomal membrane and the import of matrix proteins.

7. PSMB1 (Proteasome subunit beta type-1) is a component of the proteasome, which is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. While not a peroxisomal protein, its presence in the system may be related to the degradation of misfolded or unnecessary peroxisomal proteins.

8. SLC25A17 (Solute carrier family 25 member 17) is a peroxisomal membrane protein that functions as a transporter, potentially involved in the import of cofactors or export of metabolites.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in peroxisomal functions, including fatty acid metabolism, detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, and catabolism of D-amino acids. The presence of multiple peroxins indicates a strong emphasis on peroxisomal biogenesis and maintenance. The inclusion of PSMB1 suggests a link to protein quality control mechanisms, possibly related to peroxisomal dynamics. The system reflects a coordinated network of proteins that maintain peroxisomal integrity and metabolic functions."	0.94	0	4/13	7.643871808074462e-11	2.812063536162684e-09	PEX16;PEX5L;PEX6;PEX26	Protein Import Into Peroxisome Matrix (GO:0016558)	Protein Import Into Peroxisome Matrix 	GO:0016558	USP9X PEX10 PEX12 PEX2 PEX13 PEX14 PEX26 PEX16 PEX5L PEX5 PEX7 PEX6 TRIM37	0.6893704	0.1818181818181818	True	False	"1.

The majority of the proteins listed, including ASAH1, GBA, GLA, GLB1, GM2A, HEXA, HEXB, LIPA, MAN2B1, MANBA, NAGLU, PSAP, SGSH, and TPP1, are enzymes that localize to the lysosome, a subcellular organelle responsible for the breakdown of macromolecules. These enzymes are involved in the degradation of glycosphingolipids, which are essential components of cell membranes and play a role in cell signaling and interaction.

2. ASAH1 (acid ceramidase) hydrolyzes ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids within the lysosome, a step crucial in the metabolism of sphingolipids.

3. GBA (glucocerebrosidase) and GLA (alpha-galactosidase A) are responsible for the breakdown of glucocerebrosides and globotriaosylceramide, respectively. Mutations in these enzymes can lead to Gaucher's disease and Fabry disease, highlighting their importance in glycosphingolipid metabolism.

4. HEXA and HEXB encode the alpha and beta subunits of beta-hexosaminidase, which degrade GM2 gangliosides, and deficiencies in these enzymes result in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases.

5. LIPA (lysosomal acid lipase) breaks down cholesterol esters and triglycerides, which are important for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.

6. MAN2B1 (alpha-mannosidase) and MANBA (beta-mannosidase) are involved in the catabolism of N-linked glycoproteins by cleaving mannose residues.

7. NAGLU (alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase), SGSH (N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase), and GNS (N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase) participate in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan.

8. TPP1 (tripeptidyl-peptidase I) is a lysosomal enzyme that cleaves N-terminal tripeptides from substrates and is implicated in the neurodegenerative disorder known as late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

9. Proteins such as CTSA (cathepsin A), CTSD (cathepsin D), CTSE (cathepsin E), and LGMN (legumain) are lysosomal proteases that contribute to the proteolytic processing of proteins within the lysosome.

10. B3GLCT (beta 3-glucosyltransferase) and SIAE (sialic acid acetylesterase) are involved in the modification of glycoproteins, which is important for the proper function of lysosomal enzymes.

11. GRN (progranulin) and GUSB (beta-glucuronidase) are also associated with lysosomal function, with progranulin being implicated in lysosomal regulation and GUSB in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans.

12. PLBD2 (phospholipase B domain containing 2) and PSAP (prosaposin) are associated with lipid metabolism and lysosomal function. PSAP is a precursor of saposins, which are essential for the degradation of sphingolipids.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosphingolipids and other macromolecules, which is critical for cellular homeostasis and the prevention of lysosomal storage disorders. The interplay of these proteins ensures the efficient breakdown and recycling of cellular components, which is vital for cell survival and function."	0.95	0	5/15	4.749544360095765e-12	1.040150214860972e-09	ASAH1;GM2A;HEXB;HEXA;GLA	Ceramide Catabolic Process (GO:0046514)	Ceramide Catabolic Process 	GO:0046514	ASAH2 HEXA HEXB CEL ASAH1 GBA3 ACER3 NEU3 ACER2 NEU4 GM2A NEU1 NEU2 GLA LCT	0.52417564	0.1470588235294117	True	False	"1. The majority of the proteins listed, including ASAH1, GBA, GLA, GLB1, GM2A, HEXA, HEXB, LIPA, MAN2B1, MANBA, NAGLU, PSAP, SGSH, and TPP1, are enzymes that localize to the lysosome, a subcellular organelle responsible for the breakdown of macromolecules. These enzymes are involved in the degradation of glycosphingolipids, which are essential components of cell membranes and play a role in cell signaling and interaction.[1][2][3]

2. ASAH1 (acid ceramidase) hydrolyzes ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids within the lysosome, a step crucial in the metabolism of sphingolipids.[4][5][6]

3. GBA (glucocerebrosidase) and GLA (alpha-galactosidase A) are responsible for the breakdown of glucocerebrosides and globotriaosylceramide, respectively. Mutations in these enzymes can lead to Gaucher's disease and Fabry disease, highlighting their importance in glycosphingolipid metabolism.[7][8][9]

4. HEXA and HEXB encode the alpha and beta subunits of beta-hexosaminidase, which degrade GM2 gangliosides, and deficiencies in these enzymes result in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases.[10][11][12]

5. LIPA (lysosomal acid lipase) breaks down cholesterol esters and triglycerides, which are important for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.[13][14][15]

6. MAN2B1 (alpha-mannosidase) and MANBA (beta-mannosidase) are involved in the catabolism of N-linked glycoproteins by cleaving mannose residues.[16][17][18]

7. NAGLU (alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase), SGSH (N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase), and GNS (N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase) participate in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan.[19][20][21]

8. TPP1 (tripeptidyl-peptidase I) is a lysosomal enzyme that cleaves N-terminal tripeptides from substrates and is implicated in the neurodegenerative disorder known as late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.[22][23][24]

9. Proteins such as CTSA (cathepsin A), CTSD (cathepsin D), CTSE (cathepsin E), and LGMN (legumain) are lysosomal proteases that contribute to the proteolytic processing of proteins within the lysosome.[25][26][27]

10. B3GLCT (beta 3-glucosyltransferase) and SIAE (sialic acid acetylesterase) are involved in the modification of glycoproteins, which is important for the proper function of lysosomal enzymes.

11. GRN (progranulin) and GUSB (beta-glucuronidase) are also associated with lysosomal function, with progranulin being implicated in lysosomal regulation and GUSB in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans.[28][29][30]

12. PLBD2 (phospholipase B domain containing 2) and PSAP (prosaposin) are associated with lipid metabolism and lysosomal function. PSAP is a precursor of saposins, which are essential for the degradation of sphingolipids.[31][32][33]

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosphingolipids and other macromolecules, which is critical for cellular homeostasis and the prevention of lysosomal storage disorders. The interplay of these proteins ensures the efficient breakdown and recycling of cellular components, which is vital for cell survival and function.

ANXA9 (Annexin A9) is a member of the annexin family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. Although the specific biological functions of ANXA9 are not well characterized, annexins are generally involved in membrane-related processes such as vesicle trafficking, membrane repair, and cell signaling.

2. EFCAB6 (EF-hand calcium-binding domain 6) is a protein with limited characterization. Proteins with EF-hand motifs typically function in calcium ion binding and are implicated in a variety of calcium-dependent cellular processes.

3. LRRC47 (Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 47) is a ribosomal protein that may be involved in ribosome biogenesis or the assembly of ribosomal subunits. Ribosomal proteins are essential for protein synthesis in all living cells.

4. NAXE (NAD(P)H-hydrate epimerase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the epimerization of NAD(P)HX, a damaged form of NAD(P)H that arises under conditions of oxidative stress. This enzyme is involved in the repair of these essential cofactors.

5. PARK7 (Parkinson disease protein 7), also known as DJ-1, is involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. It may also play roles in transcriptional regulation and mitochondrial function.

6. PDZD11 (PDZ domain-containing protein 11) is a poorly characterized protein with a PDZ domain, which is typically involved in protein-protein interactions and the assembly of protein complexes.

7. RPS4X (Ribosomal protein S4, X-linked) is a component of the ribosome and is involved in the translational machinery of the cell, playing a role in protein synthesis.

8. SLC18A2 (Solute carrier family 18 member A2), also known as VMAT2, is a transporter responsible for the uptake of monoamines—such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine—into synaptic vesicles, playing a crucial role in the storage and release of neurotransmitters.

In summary, the proteins listed do not appear to be functionally related in a way that suggests a coherent biological process. They are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including vesicle trafficking, calcium signaling, ribosome biogenesis, oxidative stress response, protein-protein interactions, and neurotransmitter transport.

In summary, the proteins listed do not appear to be functionally related in a way that suggests a coherent biological process. They are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including vesicle trafficking, calcium signaling, ribosome biogenesis, oxidative stress response, protein-protein interactions, and neurotransmitter transport. There is no clear evidence of a predominant biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins. Therefore, this system is best described as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating no confidence in a unifying biological process.

The proteins listed do not appear to converge on a single, prominent biological process. Instead, they are involved in various, distinct pathways and functions within the cell. Here is a brief overview of the diversity observed:

1. AJAP1 (Adherens Junctions Associated Protein 1) is involved in cell adhesion and possibly in the suppression of cancer cell invasion.
2. AMY1B (Amylase, Alpha 1B) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into sugars, primarily in the digestive system.
3. APOA5 (Apolipoprotein A-V) plays an important role in lipid metabolism and is associated with regulating plasma triglyceride levels.
4. ART5 (ADP-ribosyltransferase 5) is an enzyme that may be involved in ADP-ribosylation reactions.
5. BFSP1 (Beaded Filament Structural Protein 1) is a lens-specific protein and is essential for the transparency and refractive index of the lens.
6. C1orf168, C2orf15, C4orf22 represent proteins that are less characterized and are named based on their chromosomal location.
7. CNIH3 (Cornichon Family AMPA Receptor Auxiliary Protein 3) is involved in the trafficking and regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors.
8. COLCA2 (Colorectal Cancer Associated 2) is a protein that may be associated with colorectal cancer.
9. CXCL17 (Chemokine (C-X-C Motif) Ligand 17) is a mucosal chemokine that is involved in the immune response.
10. DIRAS3 (DIRAS Family, GTP-Binding RAS-Like 3) is a tumor suppressor gene that may play a role in the suppression of tumor growth.
11. ENHO (Energy Homeostasis Associated) is involved in metabolic processes related to energy balance.
12. FAM133A, REP15, RNF151 represent proteins with functions that are not well characterized.
13. FBN3 (Fibrillin 3) is a member of the fibrillin family and may play a role in tissue elasticity and extracellular matrix formation.
14. GPR62, GPR85 (G Protein-Coupled Receptors 62 and 85) are receptors that may be involved in various signaling pathways.
15. GSC (Goosecoid Homeobox) is a homeobox gene that plays a role in embryonic development.
16. HHIP (Hedgehog Interacting Protein) is involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for embryonic development.
17. PRDM8 (PR Domain Containing 8) is a transcription factor that may be involved in neuronal differentiation.
18. RIPPLY1 (Ripply Transcriptional Repressor 1) is involved in embryonic development, particularly in somitogenesis.

DDX23, also known as PRP28, is an RNA helicase involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. It is a component of the U5 snRNP complex and plays a role in the catalytic step II of the splicing process. DDX23 unwinds RNA duplexes, which is essential for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA.

2. SF3A1, SF3A2, and SF3B2 are components of the splicing factor 3a and 3b complexes, respectively, which are subcomplexes of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). These proteins are critical for the assembly of the spliceosome, the large RNA-protein molecular complex that facilitates the removal of introns from pre-mRNA.

5. Proteins such as ALKBH6, QTRT1, and QTRT2 are associated with nucleic acid metabolism. ALKBH6 is an alkB homolog that may be involved in DNA repair by oxidative demethylation, while QTRT1 and QTRT2 are involved in the metabolism of queuosine, a modified nucleoside found in tRNAs, which could affect translation fidelity and efficiency.[6][7]

6. ATG2B is implicated in autophagy, a cellular degradation process that can also influence gene expression patterns indirectly through degradation of transcription factors or by modulating cellular stress responses.[8][9][10]

7. The presence of several zinc finger proteins, ZNF428 and ZNF726, suggests a role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, although their specific targets and functions within this system are not well-defined.[11]

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation, with a focus on histone modification and nucleosome assembly. The system also includes proteins that may influence gene expression post-transcriptionally or through indirect mechanisms such as autophagy and signal transduction. The interplay between these proteins suggests a complex network that governs the accessibility and expression of genetic information within the cell.

15. FAM169A, FAM229B, and FRMPD4 are proteins with functions that are not well characterized in the literature.[32][33]

16. FBN3 is a fibrillin that plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers in connective tissue.[34][35][36]

17. GOLGA8N is a member of the golgin family of proteins, which are involved in Golgi structure and function.

18. GPX2 is a glutathione peroxidase that protects cells against oxidative damage.[37][38][39]

19. MMRN1 is multimerin, which is involved in platelet adhesion or as a carrier protein for growth factors.[40][41][42]

Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying biological process, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that there is no single prominent biological process that characterizes the system as a whole.

BTN2A1 and BTN2A2 are members of the butyrophilin subfamily which play roles in immune system processes. They are implicated in T cell inhibition and may modulate immune responses.

2. CD70 and its receptor TNFRSF17 (also known as BCMA) are involved in the activation and survival of B and T cells. CD70 is expressed on activated lymphocytes and can stimulate proliferation and differentiation.

3. CLEC2B, also known as AICL, activates NK cells and may play a role in immune surveillance. KLRC4 is another NK cell receptor that can modulate immune responses.

4. CCL1 is a chemokine that attracts immune cells such as T cells to sites of inflammation, while LTB is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family involved in the recruitment of leukocytes during immune responses.

5. IL4 is a key cytokine in the regulation of immune responses, promoting the differentiation of naive helper T cells to Th2 cells and is involved in B cell proliferation.

6. TNFRSF13B (TACI) and TNFRSF13C (BAFF-R) are receptors for TNF family members that are important for B cell development and survival.

7. POU2AF1 (OBF-1) is a coactivator of OCT2 required for the expression of a subset of immunoglobulin genes during B cell development.

8. SPIB is an ETS transcription factor that controls gene expression in B cells and is essential for the differentiation of pro-B to pre-B cells.

9. MZB1 and JCHAIN are involved in the assembly and secretion of immunoglobulins, particularly IgM and IgA.

10. ITM2A and ITM2B are implicated in immune system processes, although their precise roles are not fully understood.

11. RGS13 is a regulator of G protein signaling that modulates signaling downstream of G protein-coupled receptors, including those involved in immune responses.

12. TNFAIP8 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and immune responses, potentially acting as an anti-inflammatory molecule.

13. SLC38A2 is a system A amino acid transporter that can influence immune cell function by regulating the uptake of amino acids necessary for protein synthesis and cell growth.

14. UCP2 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and can modulate immune cell activation and inflammation.

15. VNN1, VNN2, and VNN3 are involved in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation through their pantetheinase activity, which can influence leukocyte trafficking and cell adhesion.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the modulation of immune responses, including the activation and differentiation of B and T cells, NK cell function, chemotaxis, cytokine signaling, and the regulation of inflammation. The system reflects a complex network of interactions that collectively contribute to the immune system's ability to respond to pathogens and maintain homeostasis.

ARSA (arylsulfatase A), ARSB (arylsulfatase B), GUSB (beta-glucuronidase), NAGLU (alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase), SGSH (N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase), and SUMF2 (sulfatase modifying factor 2) are enzymes involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These enzymes sequentially degrade GAGs, which are complex carbohydrates attached to proteins to form proteoglycans, a major component of the extracellular matrix.

2. GALNS (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase) and CHST10 (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 10) are also involved in the modification and degradation of GAGs. GALNS specifically hydrolyzes the sulfate ester bonds of keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, while CHST10 transfers sulfate groups to position 3 of the glucosamine residue of heparan sulfate.

3. CHPF (chondroitin polymerizing factor) and CHPF2 (chondroitin polymerizing factor 2) are involved in the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate, another type of GAG, by polymerizing the glycosaminoglycan chain.

4. GALNT18 (polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18) is involved in the initial steps of mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation, which can affect the stability and function of proteins, including those involved in GAG metabolism.

5. SIAE (sialic acid acetylesterase) is involved in the regulation of sialylated glycoconjugates, which can include proteoglycans.

6. PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein) is involved in lipid metabolism and may indirectly influence the lipid environment of GAGs and proteoglycans.

7. The proteins PLXNA1 (plexin A1), PLXNA3 (plexin A3), SEMA4F (semaphorin 4F), and MEGF8 (multiple EGF-like-domains 8) are involved in cell signaling and may interact with proteoglycans or GAGs as part of their signaling pathways.

8. MOXD1 (monooxygenase DBH-like 1) and PAM (peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase) are involved in peptide modification and neurotransmitter synthesis, which may be indirectly related to GAG metabolism or signaling.

9. IL17RA (interleukin 17 receptor A) is a cytokine receptor that mediates inflammatory responses and may interact with GAGs in the immune system.

10. CERCAM (cell adhesion molecule) and CHID1 (chitinase domain containing 1) are involved in cell adhesion and immune responses, potentially interacting with the extracellular matrix and GAGs.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the metabolism, modification, and signaling of glycosaminoglycans. These processes are critical for the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and for various cellular functions, including cell adhesion, signaling, and immune responses. The system reflects a functional integration centered on GAG metabolism and sulfation, with additional roles in cell signaling and immune modulation."	0.88	0	2/5	1.1526778589426107e-05	0.0011576739448858	NAGLU;SGSH	Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan Catabolic Process (GO:0030200)	Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan Catabolic Process 	GO:0030200	IDUA NAGLU GPC1 HPSE SGSH	0.566094	0.08	True	False	"1.

The proteins APC2, CELSR1, CELSR2, CELSR3, FAT4, FREM2, FUZ, FZD1-10, INTU, NUMBL, PRICKLE1, PRICKLE3, RSG1, and VANGL1 are integral components of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for the establishment of cellular orientation within the plane of a tissue, which is orthogonal to the direction of the apical-basal axis.

2. The Frizzled family proteins (FZD1-10) are seven-pass transmembrane receptors that bind Wnt ligands and initiate PCP signaling. They work in concert with co-receptors such as VANGL1 and members of the CELSR family to transduce signals that regulate cytoskeletal organization and cell polarity.

3. The Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) proteins, represented by INTU in this system, are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and are activated downstream of Frizzled receptors.

4. Proteins such as PRICKLE1 and PRICKLE3 are post-synaptic density proteins that interact with other PCP components to modulate their activity and stabilize asymmetric cell complexes, which are essential for the directional cell behaviors.

5. APC2 is a component of the destruction complex that regulates the levels of β-catenin, a key effector in canonical Wnt signaling, which is also known to intersect with PCP signaling.

6. FAT4 and FREM2 are atypical cadherins and extracellular matrix proteins, respectively, that are implicated in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, which are influenced by PCP signaling.

7. NUMBL is a Notch signaling inhibitor that can interact with components of the Wnt/PCP pathway, suggesting a potential cross-talk between these two pathways.

8. FUZ is a planar cell polarity effector that has been implicated in ciliogenesis and is necessary for the proper orientation of cilia in response to PCP signals.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity signaling pathway, which is essential for the coordinated orientation of cells across the plane of a tissue.

ATXN3, KAT2B, KAT6A, KMT2A, and TP53 are involved in the regulation of transcription and chromatin structure. ATXN3 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can regulate transcription by editing ubiquitin chains on histones and transcription factors. KAT2B and KAT6A are histone acetyltransferases that modify chromatin structure to facilitate transcription. KMT2A is a histone methyltransferase that also plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. TP53, or p53, is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA repair.

2. CCNA2 and CHEK2 are involved in cell cycle regulation. CCNA2 (Cyclin A2) is essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S and the G2/M transitions. CHEK2 is a kinase that phosphorylates and regulates the activity of various proteins involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoints.

3. COPS5, HDAC2, HDAC3, SKP2, and SYMPK are associated with protein stability and modification. COPS5 is a component of the COP9 signalosome complex that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control and DNA damage response, through the regulation of protein degradation. HDAC2 and HDAC3 are histone deacetylases that remove acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to a more condensed chromatin state and reduced transcriptional activity. SKP2 is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. SYMPK is involved in RNA processing and may play a role in transcriptional regulation.

4. CREBBP, EP300, NCOA1, TCF3, TCF4, and TWIST1 are transcription factors or coactivators that directly interact with DNA to regulate gene expression. CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that act as transcriptional coactivators by remodeling chromatin and acetylating both histone and non-histone proteins. NCOA1 is a nuclear receptor coactivator that interacts with steroid receptors and other transcription factors to enhance transcriptional activation. TCF3 and TCF4 are members of the E-protein family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors that play critical roles in lymphocyte development, and TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in the regulation of developmental processes.

5. CTNNB1 and PYGO2 are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which has roles in cell fate determination, cell migration, cell polarity, neural patterning, and organogenesis. CTNNB1, or β-catenin, is a key downstream effector in the Wnt signaling pathway that can also act as a transcriptional coactivator. PYGO2 is a component of the Wnt signaling pathway that promotes the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and is involved in chromatin remodeling.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. They interact in a complex network that influences cell cycle progression, development, and response to cellular stress. The system's components have roles in modifying chromatin structure, regulating transcription factor activity, and controlling protein stability, all of which are critical for proper gene expression and cellular function."	0.92	10	3/9	8.34531075765874e-08	4.111962209682761e-06	KAT2B;CREBBP;EP300	Peptidyl-Lysine Acetylation (GO:0018394)	Peptidyl-Lysine Acetylation 	GO:0018394	CREBBP KAT2B KAT2A BLOC1S1 ESCO1 KAT5 EP300 KAT7 SIRT1	0.31755236	0.1111111111111111	True	False	"1.

KMT2A is a histone methyltransferase that also plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. TP53, or p53, is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA repair.[1][2][3]

2. CCNA2 and CHEK2 are involved in cell cycle regulation. CCNA2 (Cyclin A2) is essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S and the G2/M transitions. CHEK2 is a kinase that phosphorylates and regulates the activity of various proteins involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoints.[4][5][6]

3. COPS5, HDAC2, HDAC3, SKP2, and SYMPK are associated with protein stability and modification. COPS5 is a component of the COP9 signalosome complex that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control and DNA damage response, through the regulation of protein degradation. HDAC2 and HDAC3 are histone deacetylases that remove acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to a more condensed chromatin state and reduced transcriptional activity. SKP2 is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. SYMPK is involved in RNA processing and may play a role in transcriptional regulation.[7][8][9]

4. CREBBP, EP300, NCOA1, TCF3, TCF4, and TWIST1 are transcription factors or coactivators that directly interact with DNA to regulate gene expression. CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that act as transcriptional coactivators by remodeling chromatin and acetylating both histone and non-histone proteins. NCOA1 is a nuclear receptor coactivator that interacts with steroid receptors and other transcription factors to enhance transcriptional activation. TCF3 and TCF4 are members of the E-protein family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors that play critical roles in lymphocyte development, and TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in the regulation of developmental processes.[10][11][12]

5. CTNNB1 and PYGO2 are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which has roles in cell fate determination, cell migration, cell polarity, neural patterning, and organogenesis. CTNNB1, or β-catenin, is a key downstream effector in the Wnt signaling pathway that can also act as a transcriptional coactivator. PYGO2 is a component of the Wnt signaling pathway that promotes the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and is involved in chromatin remodeling.[13][14][15]

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. They interact in a complex network that influences cell cycle progression, development, and response to cellular stress. The system's components have roles in modifying chromatin structure, regulating transcription factor activity, and controlling protein stability, all of which are critical for proper gene expression and cellular function.

COPS5, also known as CSN5 or JAB1, is a component of the COP9 signalosome complex that regulates protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling by modulating the activity of key signaling intermediates through deneddylation, thus affecting the transcription of NF-κB target genes.

2. MAP3K14, also known as NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase), is a central kinase in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. It phosphorylates and activates IKKα, leading to the processing of p100 to p52 and subsequent translocation of p52/RelB heterodimers to the nucleus, which is crucial for the transcription of specific NF-κB-dependent genes.

3. MTOR, the mechanistic target of rapamycin, is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism, responding to nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy status. It is also implicated in the regulation of NF-κB signaling and autophagy, a process of cellular degradation and recycling of cellular components.

4. RNF31, also known as HOIP, is a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) that is involved in NF-κB signaling. It mediates the formation of linear ubiquitin chains on key signaling proteins, which is essential for the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway and the regulation of inflammation and immunity.

5. SQSTM1, or p62, is a multifunctional protein that serves as a scaffold in various signaling pathways, including NF-κB signaling. It also plays a critical role in autophagy by serving as a link between LC3 and ubiquitinated substrates, thus facilitating the degradation of these substrates in autophagosomes.

6. TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1, is involved in the regulation of innate immune responses. It phosphorylates and activates key substrates in the type I interferon signaling pathway and is also implicated in the regulation of autophagy through phosphorylation of autophagy-related proteins.

7. TNF, tumor necrosis factor, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in inflammation and immunity. It activates the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway through its receptor TNFR1, leading to the transcription of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation.

8. TRAF1, TNF receptor-associated factor 1, is an adaptor protein that participates in TNF receptor signaling complexes. It modulates the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and is involved in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis.

In summary, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways, both canonical and non-canonical, and autophagy. These processes are interconnected, with NF-κB signaling playing a pivotal role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, and autophagy being essential for cellular homeostasis and the response to stress.

Upon activation by caspase-8, it translocates to mitochondria and promotes the release of cytochrome c (CYCS), leading to the activation of downstream caspases. It serves as a molecular link between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis.

2. CASP1, or caspase-1, is an enzyme that plays a role in the inflammatory response and pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis. It is involved in the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although not directly apoptotic, it can influence apoptotic processes through cross-talk with other signaling pathways.

3. CYCS, cytochrome c, released from the mitochondria upon apoptotic stimuli, is a critical component of the apoptosome, a complex that activates caspase-9, leading to the activation of the caspase cascade and cell death.

4. DAXX is a multifunctional protein involved in apoptosis, transcription, and chromatin remodeling. It can enhance apoptosis by interacting with apoptosis-regulating proteins such as ASK1 and JNK.

5. MAP2K4, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, is involved in the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway. It phosphorylates and activates MAPK8, which is implicated in the transduction of apoptotic signals.

6. MAPK1, also known as ERK2, is part of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. It can play a role in the induction of apoptosis depending on the cellular context and the strength and duration of its activation.

7. MAPK8, or JNK1, is activated by various cell stresses and inflammatory cytokines. It promotes apoptosis by phosphorylating and modulating the activity of several transcription factors, and proteins like BIM and BID.

8. PSME3, also known as PA28-gamma, is a proteasome activator that has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle. It can influence the degradation of various proteins involved in apoptotic pathways.

9. SIRT1 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that modulates processes such as apoptosis and stress resistance. It can deacetylate and affect the activity of several proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway, including p53.

10. XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, is a potent inhibitor of the caspase cascade. It binds to and inhibits caspases -3, -7, and -9, thereby suppressing apoptosis.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation and execution of apoptosis. They interact in a network that integrates extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signals, stress responses, and inflammation. The system includes initiators, effectors, and regulators of apoptosis, which can have synergistic or antagonistic effects on cell death pathways.

This indicates that there is no significant evidence to suggest these proteins are functionally integrated into a single biological process.

2. DNAJC7 is a co-chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins and the prevention of misfolded protein aggregation.[4][5][6]

3. ERVH-6 is a human endogenous retrovirus protein, which may have diverse roles depending on its expression pattern.

4. ADCYAP1R1 is a receptor for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), which plays a role in neuroprotection, neurodevelopment, and modulation of inflammatory responses.[7]

5. TAGLN is a smooth muscle cell marker that plays a role in the stabilization of actin filaments.[8][9][10]

6. COQ3 is involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q, a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.[11][12][13]

7. PTPRO is a protein tyrosine phosphatase, implicated in the negative regulation of cell growth and differentiation.[14][15][16]

8. BRD2 belongs to the BET family of proteins, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.[17][18][19]

9. BCL2L11 (also known as BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family.[20][21][22]

13. CDX2 is a transcription factor critical for intestinal development and differentiation.[32][33][34]

Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying theme in their functions, it is not possible to assign a single biological process to this system. The proteins listed participate in a multitude of cellular processes that are not evidently interconnected based on the information provided. Therefore, the most accurate description for this system is a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in a unifying biological process among these proteins.

Several proteins in this system, such as STAT1, MYD88, OAS3, DHX58, and MX1, are key components of the immune response, particularly in the context of viral defense mechanisms. STAT1 is a critical transcription factor in the interferon signaling pathway, which is activated in response to viral infections. MYD88 is an adaptor protein that plays a central role in the innate immune response to pathogens. OAS3, DHX58 (also known as LGP2), and MX1 are involved in recognizing viral RNA and mediating antiviral responses.

2. Proteins like CFLAR, CASP4, BCL2L13, and MCL1 are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. CFLAR (also known as c-FLIP) is an inhibitor of death receptor signaling, which can prevent apoptosis. CASP4 is a caspase that can initiate inflammatory forms of cell death. BCL2L13 and MCL1 are members of the Bcl-2 family, which are key regulators of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

3. The presence of HLA-G, a non-classical MHC class I molecule, suggests a role in immune tolerance, particularly during pregnancy, where it contributes to the protection of the fetus from the maternal immune system.

4. Proteins such as NFKB2 and TRIM21 are involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, which is a central pathway in the immune response, inflammation, and cell survival.

5. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is represented by proteins like USP14, USP18, and UBA6, which are involved in protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes, including the immune response.

6. Proteins like NLRC5 and BATF2 are also associated with immune functions. NLRC5 is involved in the regulation of MHC class I genes, and BATF2 is a transcription factor that can be induced by interferons.

7. The system includes several proteins with roles in RNA processing and regulation, such as PNPT1, which is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing, and RBMS2, which is involved in mRNA stabilization.

8. Proteins like GALNT7 and MOCOS are involved in post-translational modifications and enzyme cofactor biosynthesis, respectively, which can indirectly affect various biological processes, including immune responses.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and homeostasis in the face of pathogenic challenge.

The proteins POP7, SNRNP200, and RYBP are involved in RNA processing and regulation. POP7 is a component of RNase P, which processes tRNA precursors, while SNRNP200 is part of the spliceosomal complex, essential for pre-mRNA splicing. RYBP is a regulator of transcription and has roles in histone modification.

2. CHAF1A and FANCG are implicated in chromatin assembly and DNA repair, respectively. CHAF1A is a component of the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, which is involved in nucleosome assembly following DNA replication. FANCG is part of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complex, crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks.

3. Proteins such as NFKBIE, FOSB, and SATB1 are transcription regulators. NFKBIE is an inhibitor of the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is activated in response to cellular stress. FOSB is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, responding to various stimuli, including growth factors and stress. SATB1 is a global chromatin organizer and gene regulator.

4. The protein complex comprising BTF3, RPL36A, and RPS28 is involved in protein synthesis. BTF3 is a subunit of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex, while RPL36A and RPS28 are components of the ribosome, essential for translation.

5. Proteins such as PARP1 and EDARADD are involved in DNA damage response and apoptosis. PARP1 is a key player in the repair of single-strand DNA breaks and is also involved in transcription regulation. EDARADD is an adaptor protein that interacts with the EDAR receptor and is involved in the developmental process and apoptosis signaling.

6. The proteins WIPI2, MYH10, and KDELR2 are associated with vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. WIPI2 is involved in autophagy, MYH10 is a non-muscle myosin involved in cellular structure and transport, and KDELR2 is part of the protein retention system in the endoplasmic reticulum.

7. Proteins such as GNB4, AK2, CYB5R2, and CYTH1 are involved in cellular metabolism and signal transduction. GNB4 is a G protein subunit involved in signal transduction, AK2 is involved in cellular energy metabolism, CYB5R2 is a cytochrome b5 reductase involved in electron transport, and CYTH1 is a cytohesin which mediates cellular adhesion and migration.

8. The immune-related proteins HLA-DMB and MICB are involved in antigen presentation and immune response. HLA-DMB is part of the MHC class II protein complex, and MICB is a ligand for the NKG2D receptor on natural killer cells and T cells.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a broad range of cellular processes, including RNA processing, DNA repair, transcription regulation, protein synthesis, DNA damage response, vesicular trafficking, signal transduction, and immune response. The most prominent processes appear to be related to cellular stress response and DNA repair mechanisms, given the involvement of multiple proteins in these pathways.

SIGLEC7 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (siglecs) family, which are typically involved in cell-cell interactions and signaling through recognition of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates. It is primarily found on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and plays a role in the inhibition of NK cell activation, thus contributing to immune regulation.

2. C11ORF85, also known as hydrocephalus-inducing protein homolog (HYDIN2), is a poorly characterized protein with limited available functional data. It is believed to be a paralog of the HYDIN gene, which is involved in ciliary function and is associated with hydrocephalus due to its role in the motility of cilia in the brain.

3. PPL, or periplakin, is a component of the cornified envelope of keratinocytes and is involved in linking the cytoskeleton to the intercellular junctions in epithelial cells. It plays a role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells and is implicated in the maintenance of skin barrier function.

4. NTN1, or netrin 1, is a secreted protein involved in axon guidance during neural development. It interacts with receptors on the surface of neurons to guide axon growth and cell migration. Netrin 1 also has roles outside the nervous system, including in angiogenesis and the regulation of epithelial cell behavior.

5. ZNF181 is a member of the zinc finger protein family, which typically acts as transcription factors binding to DNA and regulating gene expression. The specific functions of ZNF181 are not well characterized, but zinc finger proteins are generally involved in developmental processes and cellular differentiation.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, metabolism, and structural organization. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Signal Transduction: Proteins like ITGAV (integrin subunit alpha V) and ARHGEF12 (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 12) are involved in signal transduction pathways that mediate cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Similarly, ADCY9 (adenylate cyclase 9) is involved in the generation of cAMP, a second messenger important in many biological processes.

2. Gene Regulation: RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor critical for hematopoietic differentiation, while BATF2 (basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 2) is involved in the regulation of immune response genes. DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns, which is crucial for epigenetic regulation.

3. Metabolism: Enzymes like CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) are involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis, while SLC16A7 (solute carrier family 16 member 7) is a monocarboxylate transporter, which plays a role in lactate transport and metabolism.

4. Structural Components and Organization: Proteins such as SEPT6 (septin 6) are involved in cytoskeletal organization, and ROCK1 (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1) is a kinase that regulates the actin cytoskeleton.

5. DNA Repair and Maintenance: RAD51B (RAD51 paralog B) is involved in homologous recombination repair of DNA, and ALKBH2 (alkB homolog 2, alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase) is involved in DNA repair by oxidative demethylation.

6. Stress Response and Chaperones: HSPB9 (heat shock protein family B (small) member 9) is a small heat shock protein that may play a role in stress resistance and act as a chaperone.

7. Transport and Trafficking: ABCC2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 2) is involved in the transport of various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes.

6. Stress Response and Chaperones: HSPB9 (heat shock protein family B (small) member 9) is a small heat shock protein that may play a role in stress resistance and act as a chaperone.[16][17][18]

7. Transport and Trafficking: ABCC2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 2) is involved in the transport of various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes.[19][20][21]

Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying theme or process that they predominantly contribute to, it is appropriate to conclude that this system represents a ""System of unrelated proteins."" The confidence score reflects the absence of a single, prominent biological process performed by the majority of these proteins.

Several proteins in this system, such as CDC45, CCNF, AURKA, ASF1B, FANCI, CCNB1, KIF2C, CEP170, and ERCC6L, are directly involved in cell cycle regulation and progression. CDC45 is a key player in the initiation of DNA replication, while cyclin F (CCNF) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are essential for the regulation of different phases of the cell cycle. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is critical for mitotic spindle assembly, and KIF2C is involved in chromosome segregation.

2. Proteins like EXO1, DEPDC1B, and FANCI are associated with DNA repair mechanisms. EXO1 is a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair and recombination, while FANCI is part of the Fanconi anemia pathway, crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. DEPDC1B has been implicated in the regulation of cell division and may have a role in the DNA damage response.

3. The presence of proteins such as ERCC6L, a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair, and ASF1B, which is important for chromatin assembly and disassembly during DNA replication and repair, further supports the involvement of this system in DNA damage response and repair.

4. The system also includes proteins like TAF12, which is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, playing a role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and thus indirectly influencing cell cycle progression.

5. Additionally, proteins such as MYO5A, involved in organelle and vesicle transport, and AQP9, a water channel protein, suggest roles in cellular homeostasis and metabolism that can be critical for cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally interconnected through their roles in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage response.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular functions such as ion transport (SLC39A5, SLC5A12), signal transduction (EPHB1, GPR89A, IRS1), gene regulation (HEY2, MEIS2, CHD4), protein synthesis (MRPL47, RPS16P5), cell structure and motility (DPYSL5, SHROOM2), apoptosis (PDCD6), metabolism (FAAH2, RFK), and many others.

1. Several proteins like SLC39A5 and SLC5A12 are transporters, indicating roles in ion and nutrient transport, but they do not suggest a unified process.

2. Signal transduction is represented by proteins such as EPHB1 and IRS1, which are involved in different signaling pathways and do not point to a single, cohesive biological process.

3. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like HEY2 and MEIS2, but they regulate diverse sets of genes and are involved in various developmental and cellular processes.

4. Proteins involved in protein synthesis, such as MRPL47 and RPS16P5, are essential for general cellular function and do not define a specific biological process within this system.

5. Cell structure and motility are influenced by proteins like DPYSL5 and SHROOM2, but again, these proteins are involved in different aspects of cellular architecture and movement.

The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.

2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.

3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.

4. Proteins such as SLC34A1, SLC15A3, and SLC23A2 are transporters that facilitate the movement of specific substrates across cellular membranes. SLC34A1 is a phosphate transporter, SLC15A3 is a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, and SLC23A2 is a vitamin C transporter.

5. The presence of proteins like IDH3A, LDHB, and GYS1 indicates involvement in metabolic processes. IDH3A is a subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase involved in the TCA cycle, LDHB is involved in lactate metabolism, and GYS1 is glycogen synthase, which plays a role in glycogen biosynthesis.

6. Proteins such as OPTN, CEACAM1, and PLAUR are implicated in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions. OPTN is involved in autophagy and NF-κB signaling, CEACAM1 participates in cell adhesion and signaling, and PLAUR (uPAR) is involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling.

To summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.

Given the complexity and diversity of the protein functions, the confidence score is not at the maximum, as not all proteins are directly involved in the identified processes. However, the prominence of the innate immune response and apoptosis regulation components justifies a relatively high confidence score."	0.85	0	8/148	4.452441312535884e-07	0.0003606477463154	ISG20;RTP4;IFIH1;IRF1;STAT2;TLR3;RELA;IFIT2	Defense Response To Symbiont (GO:0140546)	Defense Response To Symbiont 	GO:0140546	GBP7 RAB2B GARIN5A MX1 MX2 RSAD2 ACOD1 SLFN13 IFI44L CNOT7 SLFN11 ZNFX1 IFI27 CD207 TBKBP1 RNF185 RELA IFITM2 IFITM3 IFITM1 IFI6 TANK IFNL1 PYCARD IFNL3 NLRP9 EXOSC5 IFNL2 IFI16 NLRP6 NLRP1 EXOSC4 GBP2 IFNL4 MICA GBP5 AZI2 APOBEC3D AICDA APOBEC3F APOBEC3G APOBEC3H BNIP3L DDX56 TRAF3 ISG15 MOV10 ISG20 MYD88 MAVS NT5C3A PLSCR1 PDE12 BCL2L1 NDUFAF4 MAP3K14 APOBEC3A APOBEC3B RIGI ZCCHC3 APOBEC3C IFNAR2 FCN3 IFIT5 PRF1 IFIT2 IFIT1 DDX60 IFIT3 BPIFA1 TBK1 G3BP1 DHX15 PMAIP1 MLKL ATG7 SKP2 NCBP3 RIPK3 EIF2AK2 NCBP1 CARD8 IFNLR1 LILRB1 AZU1 OAS1 USP29 TLR2 BST2 IFNE IRF1 PTPRC IL6 OAS2 OAS3 IRF2 IRF3 BCL2 TLR9 TLR8 IRF7 TLR7 ZMYND11 SERINC3 TRIM56 SERINC5 TLR3 TRIM52 CD40 CGAS NLRC5 PQBP1 TRIM5 FADD CASP1 TRIM41 STAT1 STAT2 OPRK1 RNASE6 STING1 RNASE2 RNASE1 AGBL5 AIM2 AGBL4 DDIT4 IFIT1B PLA2G10 TTC4 F2RL1 SHFL USP27X IL21 RNASEL RTP4 TRIM31 IFNA2 DDX60L LYST OASL SAMHD1 IFIH1 BNIP3 IGF2BP1 IFNB1 SETD2 IKBKE	0.4792131	0.0343347639484978	True	False	"1.

2. NRSN1 (Neurensin-1) is a brain-specific vesicle protein that may be involved in neural function or development.[4]

3. USP26 (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 26) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that may play a role in spermatogenesis.[5][6][7]

4. CFL1 (Cofilin 1) is an actin-binding protein involved in the dynamic turnover and restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton.[8][9][10]

5. C19ORF45 (Chromosome 19 Open Reading Frame 45) is a protein with unknown function.

6. MICB (MHC Class I Polypeptide-Related Sequence B) is a stress-induced ligand for the natural killer cell receptor NKG2D, involved in immune surveillance.[11][12][13]

7. CCNYL2 (Cyclin Y-Like 2) is a poorly characterized protein with potential roles in cell cycle regulation.

8. CCDC33 (Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 33) is a protein with unknown function.

9. MDH1B (Malate Dehydrogenase 1B) is an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle.

10. LRP2BP (LRP2 Binding Protein) may be involved in the regulation of the LDL receptor-related protein 2.[14][15][16]

11. STOML3 (Stomatin Like 3) is involved in sensory perception and ion channel regulation.[17][18][19]

12. ASB14 (Ankyrin Repeat and SOCS Box Containing 14) is a protein that may be involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.

13. MOGAT2 (Monoacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 2) is involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis.[20][21][22]

14. OTOP1 (Otopetrin 1) is involved in the regulation of pH sensing and balance.[23][24][25]

15. LOC401913, OR5F1, LOC153811, TTTY7, and LRRC39 are either uncharacterized proteins or genes with unknown or poorly understood functions.[26]

16. TNFRSF13C (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 13C) is a receptor involved in B-cell development and function.[27][28][29]

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unified biological process, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that there is no single prominent biological process that characterizes the interactions of these proteins.

WDR16, or WD repeat domain 16, is a protein that is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and may play a role in autophagy. The specific functions of WDR16 are not well-characterized, but given its domain structure, it is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate signal transduction pathways or assembly of protein complexes.

2. GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to internal signaling pathways. The gamma subunit, along with the beta subunit, forms a complex that interacts with the alpha subunit and receptors. GNG12 is implicated in the modulation of various signaling cascades, including those that regulate cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and possibly angiogenesis.

3. NSMAF, also known as neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activation associated factor, is involved in the ceramide signaling pathway. Ceramide is a lipid molecule that acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling cascades, particularly those related to stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis. NSMAF is thought to be involved in the activation of N-SMase, which leads to the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling. WDR16 may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes or pathways, GNG12 is directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and NSMAF is associated with lipid signaling pathways. While the specific interactions between these proteins are not well-defined, their collective involvement in signaling suggests a role in modulating intracellular communication and response to external stimuli. The confidence score reflects the fact that while each protein is involved in signaling, the direct connections and integration of their functions within a single, prominent biological process are not fully established."	0.75	0	1/55	0.0082276520870908	0.0140344078673636	NSMAF	Ceramide Metabolic Process (GO:0006672)	Ceramide Metabolic Process 	GO:0006672	TLCD3B AGK PPP2R1A DEGS2 DEGS1 NSMAF ASAH2 SAMD8 ST6GALNAC3 SGMS2 CERK SGMS1 ALOX12B CYP4F22 FUT3 ASAH1 FUT5 FUT7 FUT6 SGPL1 ORMDL3 SPTSSA SPTSSB ALOXE3 ABCA2 CERS4 CERS5 CERS6 GDF1 CEL ORMDL1 ORMDL2 PPP2CA ACER3 FA2H ACER2 TM9SF2 ACER1 PLA2G15 PLPP3 PNPLA1 CERS2 PLPP2 ST6GALNAC6 CERS3 PLPP1 GBA1 CLN8 CLN6 SMPD4 SPTLC1 SPTLC2 SPTLC3 SMPD2 SMPD1	0.35338673	0.0175438596491228	False	False	"1.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, protein processing, cellular metabolism, and immune responses. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Signal Transduction: Proteins like MAP3K7, GPR110, and TNFRSF11A are involved in different signaling pathways. MAP3K7 is a kinase that plays a role in the NF-kappaB pathway, while GPR110 is a G protein-coupled receptor, and TNFRSF11A is a receptor for TNFSF11/RANKL and is important for osteoclastogenesis.

2. Gene Regulation: Transcription factors like FOXP1 and KLF5 are involved in regulating gene expression. FOXP1 is implicated in the development of several tissues, including the heart and lung, while KLF5 plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.

3. Protein Processing and Trafficking: SEC61B is part of the protein translocation apparatus in the endoplasmic reticulum, and KDELR2 is involved in the retrieval of ER-resident proteins. Proteins like CUL4A and UBE4B are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for protein degradation.

4. Metabolism: Enzymes like GDA (guanine deaminase) and GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase) are involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, respectively.

5. Immune Response: HLA-DRB1 is an MHC class II cell surface receptor important for the immune system to recognize foreign molecules.

6. RNA Processing: Proteins like SRRM1 and DDX54 are involved in RNA splicing and remodeling, which are critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

7. Cell Cycle and Division: NEK2 is a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, and STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division.

8. Apoptosis and Cell Survival: MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, while TNFSF10 (TRAIL) is a cytokine that induces apoptosis.

9. Structural Components: TPM1 is a tropomyosin protein that plays a role in the structure and function of the cytoskeleton.

The proteins listed span various functional categories, including transcription regulation (e.g., KLF5, ZNF622), protein degradation (e.g., RFWD2, MKRN2), intracellular transport (e.g., VPS33A, TIMM23), metabolic processes (e.g., UMPS, GNPAT), and signal transduction (e.g., PPP3CC, ATR). 

1. Several zinc finger proteins (e.g., ZNF845, ZNF79, ZNF131, ZNF419) are present, which typically act as transcription factors, each likely regulating distinct sets of genes. Their specific targets and functions can be diverse, ranging from developmental processes to cellular stress responses.

2. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like NFYC (nuclear transcription factor Y subunit), MYD88 (adapter protein involved in the innate immune response), and FOSL1 (a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex).[4][5][6]

3. Metabolic enzymes and transporters are also present, such as ALDH6A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase), ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter), and CLCN5 (chloride channel protein).[7][8][9]

4. Structural and motor proteins like MYH6 (myosin heavy chain), ACTR2 (actin-related protein 2), and TPM2 (tropomyosin) are involved in muscle contraction and cytoskeletal organization.[10][11][12]

5. Immune response and antiviral activity are represented by proteins like ISG15 (ubiquitin-like modifier), IFIT3 (interferon-induced protein), and IFNA5 (interferon alpha).[13][14][15]

6. Cell cycle and DNA repair mechanisms include proteins such as RIF1 (telomere-associated protein) and TOP1 (topoisomerase).[16][17][18]

Given the broad spectrum of functions and the lack of a unifying biological process, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that there is no single prominent biological process that encompasses the majority of the proteins listed.

2. Gene Expression Regulation: CHD1 and CBX1 are chromatin remodelers and histone-binding proteins, respectively, which influence gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. SENP5 is a SUMO protease that regulates the post-translational modification of proteins, affecting their function and localization.

3. Protein Synthesis and Processing: EIF3A is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex, essential for protein synthesis. EFTUD1 is involved in spliceosome assembly, which is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing.

4. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis: Proteins like REC8 are involved in meiotic chromosome segregation, while DFNA5 has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis.

5. Metabolism: Enzymes such as GLS and BPNT1 are involved in glutamine metabolism and purine metabolism, respectively.

6. Intracellular Trafficking: SAR1B, SEC31B, and RAB proteins like RAB14 and RAB20 are involved in vesicular transport processes.

7. Structural and Motor Proteins: KLC1 and DCTN2 are components of the kinesin motor complex and dynein complex, respectively, which are involved in intracellular transport.

8. Miscellaneous Functions: Other proteins like CSF1, which is a growth factor for blood monocytes, and PCDH10, which is a member of the protocadherin family involved in cell-cell adhesion, represent additional diverse functions.

5. Metabolism: Enzymes such as GLS and BPNT1 are involved in glutamine metabolism and purine metabolism, respectively.[10][11][12]

6. Intracellular Trafficking: SAR1B, SEC31B, and RAB proteins like RAB14 and RAB20 are involved in vesicular transport processes.[13][14][15]

7. Structural and Motor Proteins: KLC1 and DCTN2 are components of the kinesin motor complex and dynein complex, respectively, which are involved in intracellular transport.[16][17][18]

8. Miscellaneous Functions: Other proteins like CSF1, which is a growth factor for blood monocytes, and PCDH10, which is a member of the protocadherin family involved in cell-cell adhesion, represent additional diverse functions.[19][20][21]

Given the broad range of unrelated functions and the lack of a unifying biological process, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that there is no single prominent biological process that characterizes the system of interacting proteins provided.

Several proteins in this system, such as MCM8, RPA1, and POLR3D, are involved in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. MCM8 is part of the minichromosome maintenance complex necessary for the initiation of DNA replication. RPA1 is involved in DNA replication and repair, while POLR3D is a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which synthesizes small RNAs and is involved in cell growth and maintenance.

2. Proteins like NFKB2, PPP1R15A, and HES1 are key components in stress response and signaling pathways. NFKB2 is part of the NF-kappa-B family of transcription factors that play a crucial role in inflammation and immune responses. PPP1R15A, also known as GADD34, is involved in the stress-induced regulation of protein synthesis. HES1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is implicated in cell differentiation and proliferation.

3. Proteins such as RAC1, CCT3, and RNF115 are involved in cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking, and protein ubiquitination, respectively. RAC1 is a small GTPase that regulates the formation of actin cytoskeleton. CCT3 is a chaperonin involved in the proper folding of actin and tubulin. RNF115 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of proteins, targeting them for degradation.

4. Proteins like CDV3, CBR3-AS1, and MET are involved in various cellular processes. CDV3 is associated with vesicle-mediated transport, CBR3-AS1 is a non-coding RNA that may regulate gene expression, and MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, motility, and differentiation.

5. Several ribosomal proteins, including RPS6P6, RPL14, RPL34, and RPL31, are present, indicating a role in protein synthesis. These proteins are components of the ribosome and are essential for the translation of mRNA into proteins.

6. Proteins like LPAR3 and FLCN are involved in cell signaling and nutrient sensing. LPAR3 is a G-protein coupled receptor for lysophosphatidic acid, which mediates cell proliferation and survival. FLCN is a tumor suppressor that may be involved in energy and nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, with a significant number participating in cell proliferation, DNA replication, stress response, and protein synthesis. The interplay between these proteins suggests a complex network that regulates cell growth and responds to cellular stress.

1. Several proteins such as TSPEAR, SST (somatostatin), PAX6, and METTL3 are involved in distinct cellular processes. For example, TSPEAR is associated with Notch signaling and development, SST is a hormone that inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones, PAX6 is a key regulatory gene in eye and neural development, and METTL3 is involved in mRNA methylation, impacting RNA stability and translation.

2. Proteins like SETMAR, ZMIZ1, and SMAD7 are implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, respectively. These proteins play roles in maintaining genomic integrity, regulating gene expression, and modulating cell signaling pathways.

3. Proteins such as GNG3 (a G protein subunit), KIF2C (a kinesin involved in mitosis), and STK3 (a serine/threonine kinase) are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and apoptosis, which are fundamental cellular processes but not indicative of a unified biological process within this system.

4. Transport and trafficking proteins like SLC19A2 (a thiamine transporter), MAGOH (involved in mRNA splicing and export), and ABCA6 (a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family) highlight the diversity of functions related to cellular transport mechanisms present in this system.

Several proteins in this system, such as IRF1, IRF7, IRF9, ISG15, and IFI35, are key components of the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. These proteins are involved in the transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which play a crucial role in the innate immune response against viral infections.

2. Proteins like OAS1 and RNASEL are part of the antiviral response, where they detect viral RNA and activate pathways that degrade viral nucleic acids, inhibiting viral replication.

3. TRIM21, TRIM22, and TRIM38 are members of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein family, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases that facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, including those from invading pathogens.

4. TAP1, PSME2, and HLA-F are involved in antigen processing and presentation. TAP1 is part of the transporter associated with antigen processing, which transports peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. PSME2 is a component of the immunoproteasome that processes antigens for presentation, and HLA-F is a non-classical MHC class I molecule that may be involved in immune regulation.

5. TNFAIP3 (A20) and GADD45A are involved in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. TNFAIP3 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that negatively regulates NF-kB signaling, while GADD45A is involved in stress-induced apoptosis and DNA repair.

6. Proteins such as EIF2AK1 and EIF2A are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, particularly under stress conditions such as viral infection. EIF2AK1 phosphorylates EIF2, leading to a reduction in global protein synthesis, which is a host defense mechanism to prevent viral protein translation.

7. CMPK2, DNAJB11, PDIA4, and DNAJB9 are involved in various aspects of cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis during viral infections.

8. Proteins like CXCL10 are chemokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection, while LIFR is involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses.

RNMT, the RNA (guanine-7-) methyltransferase, is involved in mRNA cap methylation, which is crucial for mRNA stability and efficient translation, processes that are particularly important under stress conditions where protein synthesis needs to be tightly regulated.

2. SAMD9L, the sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein, has been implicated in the innate immune response and may also play a role in cellular stress responses, potentially by regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis.

3. CEBPB and CEBPG are members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family and function as transcription factors that regulate genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, as well as in cellular metabolism, particularly under stress conditions.

4. PSMD12, a component of the 19S proteasome, is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process that is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, especially during cellular stress when damaged proteins accumulate.

5. RSRC2 and HNRNPA1 are RNA-binding proteins that influence RNA splicing and stability, which are critical for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during stress responses.

6. XBP1 is a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to restore normal function by enhancing the production of molecular chaperones and components of the protein degradation machinery.

7. GADD45A is involved in the response to environmental stress and DNA damage, and it plays a role in growth arrest and apoptosis, which are important for cellular recovery and adaptation to stress.

8. USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can regulate the stability of proteins involved in the DNA damage response and may also influence other stress response pathways.

9. HIAT1, MSANTD3, NDFIP1, WRB, KLHL36, EIF2A, CALML4, GCLM, KDM5B, GNA12, ZNF655, and METTL21B are proteins with various functions, including neurotransmitter transport (HIAT1), regulation of gene expression (MSANTD3, KDM5B, ZNF655), protein translation initiation (EIF2A), calcium signaling (CALML4), redox homeostasis (GCLM), and protein methylation (METTL21B). These proteins may contribute to the overall cellular response to stress by modulating specific pathways or cellular processes.

Given the broad spectrum of unrelated functions and the lack of a unifying theme or pathway among these proteins, it is appropriate to conclude that this system does not represent a coherent biological process. Therefore, the most accurate description for this collection of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" and the confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in a singular biological process being represented by this system.
