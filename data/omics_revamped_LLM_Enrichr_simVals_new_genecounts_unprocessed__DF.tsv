It is involved in p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis triggered by various stimuli, including DNA damage and growth factor deprivation. BBC3 acts by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, neutralizing their protective effect and thus promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is a critical step in apoptosis.

2. PMAIP1, known as NOXA, is another pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Similar to BBC3, it is implicated in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is regulated by p53. PMAIP1 preferentially binds to MCL1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and targets it for proteasomal degradation, thereby tipping the balance towards apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

3. CC2D1A is a transcriptional co-regulator that has been implicated in neural development and is known to interact with the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A. While its direct role in apoptosis is less clear compared to BBC3 and PMAIP1, it has been associated with signaling pathways that can influence cell survival and apoptosis indirectly.

5. GABBR1 and GABBR2 encode the subunits of the GABA(B) receptor, which is involved in neurotransmission. While not directly related to transcriptional regulation, their interaction with the system could suggest a role in cellular signaling pathways that influence gene expression.

6. GOLGA1 (also known as golgin A1) is involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and may play a role in the trafficking of proteins that are crucial for transcriptional regulation.

7. JAKMIP1 (Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1) is associated with microtubules and may be involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene expression.

8. MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein) is a transcription factor that can bind to G/C-rich DNA sequences and is implicated in gene expression regulation and DNA repair.

9. POU6F1 (POU class 6 homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that may play a role in the development of the nervous system and in the regulation of gene expression.

10. UTF1 (Undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1) is associated with maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and may regulate gene expression during early development.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to cellular stress and developmental signals. They include transcription factors that respond to stress, regulate metabolism, and control developmental processes. The presence of GABA(B) receptor subunits suggests a potential link to signal transduction pathways that modulate the activity of these transcription factors. The system appears to be functionally integrated around the regulation of gene expression in response to various intracellular and extracellular stimuli, with a significant emphasis on the cellular stress response."	0.92	0	11/1922	1.7378905059273052e-08	2.921302065843115e-06	ATF1;CREB1;DDIT3;MAZ;CEBPG;CREM;UTF1;JDP2;BATF;POU6F1;ATF4	Regulation Of DNA-templated Transcription

The selected genes support the given name ""Cellular Stress Response and Gene Expression Regulation"" because they are predominantly involved in transcriptional regulation in response to cellular stress and developmental signals. These genes include transcription factors that respond to stress, regulate metabolism, and control developmental processes, aligning well with the suggested name.

-- Explanation --
ATF1: High
ATF1 is a member of the ATF/CREB protein family, regulating gene transcription in response to hormonal and stress signals.

ATF4: High
ATF4 is involved in the cellular stress response, particularly the unfolded protein response (UPR) and amino acid metabolism.

CREB1: High
CREB1 is part of the ATF/CREB protein family, regulating gene transcription in response to hormonal and stress signals.

CREM: High
CREM is a member of the ATF/CREB protein family, involved in regulating gene transcription in response to hormonal and stress signals.

BATF: High
BATF is a bZIP transcription factor involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and differentiation of immune cells.

JDP2: High
JDP2 is a bZIP transcription factor that represses transcription and is implicated in cellular stress response mechanisms.

CEBPG: High
CEBPG is a transcriptional regulator involved in cell cycle and metabolism, acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor of other C/EBP family members.

DDIT3: High
DDIT3 is a transcription factor induced by cellular stress, particularly during the ER stress response, and regulates apoptosis.

MAZ: High
MAZ is a transcription factor implicated in gene expression regulation and DNA repair.

POU6F1: High

CDCA5 (Sororin) plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion during the S phase of the cell cycle, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. It interacts with cohesin complexes to maintain cohesion between sister chromatids after DNA replication.

2. DNMT1 is the primary enzyme responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns following DNA replication. It ensures the proper hereditary transmission of epigenetic information, which is critical for gene expression regulation and genome stability.

3. FANCD2 is a key component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks that otherwise could lead to chromosomal instability. It is monoubiquitinated and recruited to sites of DNA damage, promoting repair and maintaining genomic integrity.

4. KIFC1 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a role in chromosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis. It is also implicated in the transport of vesicles and organelles, which can indirectly affect DNA replication and repair processes.

5. ORC1 is a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that is essential for the initiation of DNA replication. It binds to replication origins and participates in the formation of pre-replicative complexes, ensuring that DNA replication starts at the correct sites and time.

6. POLH is a DNA polymerase involved in translesion synthesis, allowing DNA replication to continue past sites of damage. It helps maintain genetic stability by preventing stalling of the replication machinery at damaged sites.

7. RAD18 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in post-replication repair by monoubiquitinating PCNA, which is involved in DNA replication and repair. This modification allows recruitment of translesion synthesis polymerases to bypass DNA lesions.

8. REV3L is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, which is involved in translesion synthesis. It facilitates DNA synthesis past DNA lesions that would otherwise block replicative polymerases, contributing to DNA damage tolerance.

CEBPB functions as a transcription factor regulating genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, and cellular metabolism under stress conditions.

CEBPG: High
CEBPG, like CEBPB, is a transcription factor involved in immune and inflammatory responses, and cellular metabolism under stress conditions.

PSMD12: High
PSMD12 is part of the 19S proteasome, essential for degrading ubiquitinated proteins and maintaining protein homeostasis during cellular stress.

RSRC2: Medium
RSRC2 influences RNA splicing and stability, critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during stress responses.

HNRNPA1: Medium
HNRNPA1, an RNA-binding protein, affects RNA splicing and stability, crucial for gene expression regulation during stress responses.

XBP1: High
XBP1 is a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response, activated by ER stress to restore normal function.

GADD45A: High
GADD45A is involved in the response to environmental stress and DNA damage, playing a role in growth arrest and apoptosis.

USP28: Medium
USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme regulating protein stability in the DNA damage response and other stress pathways.

EIF2A: Medium
EIF2A is involved in protein translation initiation, contributing to the cellular response to stress.

GCLM: Medium
GCLM is involved in redox homeostasis, which is crucial for cellular response to oxidative stress.

KDM5B: Medium
KDM5B regulates gene expression, contributing to cellular stress responses.
