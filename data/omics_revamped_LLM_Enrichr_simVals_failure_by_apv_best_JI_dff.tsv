Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.

2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.

3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.

4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.

5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.

6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.

7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses."	0.88	0	16/705	4.800638292211621e-09	4.301371909821612e-06	PRR7;BEX1;ASNS;FOXO3;RHOB;DNAJA1;SFRP1;BCL6;CASP6;MYC;FLNA;MNDA;ATF5;SKP2;PHLDA1;HSPA1A	Regulation Of Apoptotic Process (GO:0042981)	Regulation Of Apoptotic Process 	GO:0042981	MED1 LACRT PRELID1 UNC13B BAD WDR73 SCRIB DKK1 USP17L3 USP17L4 USP17L1 USP17L2 HNRNPK IL31RA HSPA1A TEK YME1L1 BAX CIAPIN1 TNFSF9 VIP HSPA1B LEF1 PRKAA2 ANKLE2 TRRAP RPL10 SCX NUGGC ARAF PRKAA1 ASCL1 SPDEF USP17L7 USP17L8 PRAP1 TFPT USP17L5 MYC AKT1 AKT2 CYP1B1 NKX2-6 NKX2-5 PROK2 SNCA ZNF268 HOXA5 TAF9B KLF11 PLK5 SIGMAR1 GPLD1 WNT10B ZBTB7A PRKCI PLK1 NCKAP1L TSLP ACTL6A PLK3 PLK2 FZD9 ZNF16 SUPV3L1 LATS2 LATS1 MLLT11 SETX PLSCR3 BIN1 KCNMA1 PPT1 ATF6 CRYAB ATF4 ATF5 CRYAA FANK1 PHB2 PHB1 HPN MEAF6 TFRC BCL10 GATA6 PRKDC SLC6A2 GATA1 PRDX3 DSTYK PRDX5 PRDX2 FIGNL1 MLST8 NUP62 MYO18A ATG7 IER3 BARD1 DUSP6 ANXA1 JUN ANXA4 RIPK3 ANXA5 SPHK2 SPHK1 AZU1 PAX7 BRAF SIRT1 PAWR PAX2 PAX8 GAS1 GAS6 ARF4 HRK TRIM2 MTDH RNF157 BCLAF1 SHH CTLA4 PLEKHN1 RIPK1 EGLN2 DFFA EGLN3 MEF2C MGMT STAT1 NR1H4 RRP1B SEPTIN4 DHRS2 SERPINB9 DAB2IP CLIP3 RYBP APEX1 ANGPTL4 FABP1 RNF122 PHLPP1 RARG HTT GSTP1 FMN2 FSTL1 ING5 ING3 ING4 AIFM2 ADAMTSL4 TCTN3 AIFM1 SMPD1 HS1BP3 NME2P1 PRAME RACK1 RICTOR BRD8 JAK3 TMEM14A BID AREL1 BIK PHLDA1 RPS6 SEMA4D FBXO11 AGT FBXO10 HIPK3 COPS5 CXCL10 MORF4L1 OLFM1 MORF4L2 MELK WT1 OLFM4 PINK1 IAPP YEATS4 PDCD5 FKBP8 IL6ST PDCD2 PHIP MRE11 SQSTM1 PTPN6 TARDBP MAD2L1 VTCN1 CLU PARK7 TNF EGFR FOXO3 HSP90B1 FOXO1 RUVBL1 PYCARD BCL2L11 FRZB HMGN5 DDRGK1 BCL2L10 NTF3 RUVBL2 CFL1 FLNA SAP18 RPS3 PHLDA3 MAP3K5 C8ORF17 WFS1 BNIP3L IGFBP3 TNFRSF10D TNFRSF10C TNFRSF10B TNFRSF10A TRAF2 NFKB1 LSM8 STK26 BCL2L1 BIRC5 MAP3K10 BIRC6 MAP3K11 BIRC7 BIRC8 SLC27A4 BIRC2 BIRC3 BCL2L2 MDM2 NOTCH2 FASLG VPS72 BAG3 BAG4 BAG1 CLEC5A ABL2 PIM2 TNFRSF8 TXNDC5 PIM1 ABL1 BMF PIM3 MOAP1 DNM1L ANGPT4 HSP90AA1 API5 ANGPT1 APAF1 ASNS CFLAR PA2G4 NRG1 OSGIN1 DHCR24 FOXL2 HAX1 SON DNAJC3 DAB2 USP17L6P BCL6 CDK5 TMBIM4 ALB BCL3 NF2 BCL2 CDK1 NF1 ITGA6 TMBIM6 TNFRSF25 MCM2 ALK BCAR1 SHC1 GLO1 MAPKAP1 TRADD NLRC4 APIP HTR2B SAV1 KNG1 PIP5KL1 EMILIN2 NAE1 AMH EMILIN1 BOK IP6K2 ZNF622 CTNNBL1 MCL1 NTRK1 STYK1 GRID2 GZMA MTOR TBX3 DNAJA1 EVI2B IL2RB DNAJA3 MNDA FXN NOP53 TPT1 TRIM35 MTCH1 ITGB1 MTCH2 HDAC3 SRC USP27X FLT3 HDAC1 FLT4 HDAC2 FHL2 ETFA MALT1 MIEN1 OPA1 IGF2BP1 BAK1 FYN C3ORF38 TRIM24 ACTN4 ACTN3 ACTN2 ACTN1 CRADD CIDEB CIDEC PNMA5 CIDEA PNMA3 MAPK8IP3 CCAR1 SFRP4 SFRP2 APC NEURL1 HIP1R ANP32E NSMF ANP32C ALPK2 NAIP ZNF830 TP53 GLS2 LRP2 KHDC3L USP17L20 USP17L22 USP17L21 USP17L24 SFRP1 AQP1 LRP8 CCAR2 ACTB NUAK2 PDCD10 E2F1 APBB1 KDR NTSR1 CCNL2 MAGEA4 EGR1 SIAH1 EGR3 TNFSF18 XBP1 GADD45B GADD45A SIAH2 TOMM70 GADD45G IGF1 TENT5B PTK2 RNF144B ACER2 PIK3R1 WNK3 RNPS1 TDGF1 TNFRSF6B FOXE3 ANP32B BEX1 MAGED1 ANP32A ARL6IP1 DCUN1D3 IFIT2 IKZF3 IFIT3 SOX4 RASSF2 LGALS2 PKHD1 TCL1A LGALS1 KAT5 MBTD1 EPC1 ARL6IP5 EPC2 FFAR4 SOX9 TNFSF10 SOX8 SKP2 CTSB IL10 NLRP2B TNFRSF12A TSC22D1 LILRB1 NME1 RHOB VEGFA NME2 PTMA TFAP4 TOX3 KRT18 CEACAM5 ATM CD28 TAX1BP1 CD27 CALR EEF1E1 FATE1 ARHGEF7 SGK1 PXT1 CSRNP3 CITED1 CITED2 TOP2A OMA1 KIF14 PCSK9 CD3E CX3CL1 IER3IP1 BABAM2 SOCS3 SOCS2 C1QBP HTATIP2 ANKRD1 CD38 CTSH FADD MAP3K20 CTSD NEUROD1 USP17L17 NPM1 USP17L19 USP17L18 PRMT2 DKKL1 HYPK USP17L11 THOC6 USP17L13 ANO6 ITCH USP17L12 HCK USP17L15 RSL1D1 TJP1 BRMS1 STK17A STK17B XIAP AVP GHRL CD40LG CD44 HIP1 ANKRD13C FOXA1 FAF1 CTNNB1 FAIM2 PTMS SH3RF2 SH3RF1 SPTLC1 PNMA2 PNMA1 LCMT1 MAP4K4 TFAP2B CD74 PRLR TGFB3 WNT5A ATAD3A GCG POU4F1 KLHL20 PPIA SHQ1 UBE2Z AXL NUPR1 FAS PPIF DPEP1 PPID RAF1 TFAP2A PRDM9 PAGE4 PRKN RELA NOL3 ZFAND6 MPO CIB1 IFI6 COMP PTPA PAK2 CCND2 PDPN CAPN3 SLIT2 EP400 DMAP1 NIBAN2 OPN3 USP47 SMAD5 PCID2 STIL UTP11 HGF MRGBP POU3F3 SMAD6 PROC GCLC DDAH2 GDNF USP42 CARD14 FCMR RTKN VCP HTRA4 HTRA2 PSEN1 TRIAP1 HTRA1 PSEN2 IGF1R HIGD1A MYDGF TGM2 ARHGAP21 CALHM2 UBB FAM162A UBD PMAIP1 DYNAP HSPA9 STPG1 NAT8B RFPL1 ATP13A2 CBX4 HSPA5 NAA35 RHBDD1 HMGA2 MT3 BFAR RPS3A MMP9 DNM2 HIGD2A IL2 AHI1 BMP4 IL4 RASA1 IL7 BMP2 IL6 JMY IRF5 TMIGD1 AKT1S1 IRF3 PANO1 QRICH1 RBM25 USP36 PSMD10 RTN4 DDX3X GSK3B AVEN DIABLO BCL2A1 TNFAIP8 HMGB1 DDX42 HSPB1 STK3 STK4 CASP8 SCIN CASP9 CASP6 ERBB4 GRK5 ERBB2 ERBB3 GPER1 CASP2 CASP3 ECT2 WNT1 PIDD1 DAPK2 DAPK1 DAPK3 OXSR1 PLAUR YWHAZ SOD1 GOLPH3 GREM1 UFM1 CAT ERCC5 REST RPS6KB1 TCIM ERCC3 NAA15 TAF9 SPRY2 NAA16 VDAC1 LTF PRR5 LTK PRR7 THBS1 DDX20 ACVR1C HSPD1 CBL FLCN GRM4 ARHGDIA RBM5 CLN3 MAPK8 RPS6KA1 RPS6KA3 RPS6KA2 SIX4 BNIP2 PTK2B VHL BNIP3 BNIP1 IFT57	0.4017275	0.020969855832241154	0.21621621621621623	True	False

BBS9 and BBS10 are part of the BBSome complex, which is involved in the structure and function of cilia, cellular organelles that play a critical role in various signaling pathways and sensory functions. Mutations in these proteins are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction leading to retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, and kidney abnormalities.

2. LZTFL1 and MKKS (also known as BBS6) are also associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome and ciliary function. LZTFL1 is thought to regulate the BBSome complex's ciliary trafficking, while MKKS has a dual role in both ciliogenesis and the cell cycle regulation.

3. TTC8 (also known as BBS8) is another component of the BBSome complex, contributing to the structure and function of cilia. Like BBS9 and BBS10, mutations in TTC8 can lead to Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

4. PSMA5 is a component of the proteasome, a complex responsible for protein degradation, which is essential for many cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and signal transduction. While not directly related to ciliary function, proteasomal activity can influence the turnover of ciliary components and thus indirectly affect ciliary function.

5. RNF19A is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which tags proteins with ubiquitin for degradation by the proteasome. It may have a role in the regulation of proteins involved in ciliary function through targeted degradation.

6. DPP3 is a dipeptidyl-peptidase that cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of protein substrates. It is not directly linked to ciliary function but could be involved in the processing of signaling molecules that participate in ciliary signaling pathways.

To summarize, the majority of the genes in this set encode proteins that are directly involved in the formation, maintenance, and function of cilia, with a strong association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy. The presence of proteins involved in protein degradation suggests a regulatory mechanism for controlling the turnover of ciliary components. The system of interacting proteins appears to be primarily involved in ciliopathy-related processes, with a focus on the BBSome complex and its regulation."	0.88	0	4/243	1.4323160272917946e-06	7.734506547375691e-05	MKKS;TTC8;BBS10;BBS9	Cilium Assembly (GO:0060271)	Cilium Assembly 	GO:0060271	DYNC2H1 CFAP74 DNAAF3 WDPCP CFAP70 DNAAF1 RSPH6A BBIP1 RFX3 IFT81 ARMC9 IFT80 RFX2 TMEM80 TTC39C IFT88 CEP83 ALPK1 CEP89 ATP6V0D1 HOATZ GORAB IFT172 AVIL FNBP1L PTPDC1 CSNK1D TMEM67 IFT74 E2F4 RILP PLK4 RAB3IP WDR54 EHD1 BBS10 EHD2 VANGL2 EHD3 EHD4 FHDC1 CFAP58 CIBAR1 DZIP1 CIBAR2 SSX2IP CFAP54 CCNO MKS1 UNC119B PLA2G3 TXNDC15 TTBK2 NUDCD3 MCIDAS DZIP1L PIERCE1 CCDC96 PIERCE2 CCDC113 BBS2 BBS1 CPLANE1 OFD1 CPLANE2 IFT122 WDR35 TTLL8 CENPJ NME8 TTLL3 CEP41 GAS8 ARF4 C2CD3 DYNLT2B FBF1 INTU RILPL1 HSPB11 CFAP298 STK36 BBS9 DISC1 BBS7 CC2D2A CC2D2B BBS5 BBS4 RSPH4A DYNLL1 GBF1 SEPTIN2 MBD1 IFT140 WDR19 SEPTIN6 SEPTIN7 ATAT1 TTC8 CFAP161 RILPL2 BBOF1 HYLS1 CEP20 RP1L1 SPAG17 DYNC2I2 TRAF3IP1 MACIR SNX10 SPAG16 TBC1D32 TCTN3 TBC1D31 TCTN2 TCTN1 RAB8A JHY DYNC2I1 RAB8B GSN FBXW8 OCRL RPGRIP1L TMEM250 DCDC2 TMEM138 FAM161A TTC30A UBXN10 B9D2 PHIP B9D1 CEP126 RAB1A CEP19 GALNT11 ABLIM1 RAB23 ABLIM3 ASAP1 KIAA0753 TEKT1 TEKT2 CEP250 FLNA NPHP3 TEKT3 TEKT4 TEKT5 TRAPPC14 PCNT ENKD1 TTC36 CCDC13 RABL2B TTC21B KIF24 TMEM231 KIF27 LRRC43 DUSP23 IFT20 DNMBP TMEM17 IFT22 TMEM237 MAK CILK1 IFT27 ATP6V1D NOTCH1 ARL6 ARL3 CDC14A CDC14B CDC14C DNAAF11 KIF3B KIF3A TMEM107 NEK1 PIBF1 CCDC39 ACTR3 MKKS ACTR2 IQCB1 FUZ PARVA AHI1 IFT43 RPGRIP1 CFAP221 TMEM216 CEP162 ZMYND10 IFT46 CCDC40 SPACA9 TTC26 DNAH5 LRGUK FAM149B1 CEP164 CFAP206 PTPN23 SPATA6 DYNC2LI1 CFAP47 CEP290 SNAP29 CFAP43 DNAI2 CFAP46 CCDC57 CEP131 SCLT1 FOXJ1 RP2 RP1 KIAA0586 RSPH9 CCDC65 CCDC66 RAB17 RSPH1 CLUAP1 HDAC6 CFAP20 DCTN1 RPGR CCDC28B WDR90 ARL13A ARL13B IFT52 IQUB TOGARAM1 POC1B IFT57 POC1A	0.6183443	0.016194331983805668	0.5	True	False

ACTL6A, CHD3, and ING4 are components of chromatin remodeling complexes that alter the structure of chromatin to regulate access to DNA. ACTL6A is part of the SWI/SNF complex, which is involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes. CHD3 is a member of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex, which has roles in chromatin compaction and gene silencing. ING4 associates with histone acetyltransferase complexes and can modulate chromatin structure and transcription.

2. BCL6, CREBBP, EP300, NR3C1, RELA, RUNX1, TP53, and YY1 are transcription factors or co-regulators that directly influence gene expression. BCL6 is a sequence-specific repressor of transcription, while CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that activate transcription by remodeling chromatin. NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response. RELA is a subunit of NF-kB, a transcription factor involved in inflammatory and immune responses. RUNX1 is critical for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. TP53 (p53) is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in apoptosis, growth arrest, and DNA repair. YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor that can act as an activator, repressor, or initiator-binding protein.

3. H2AFZ and HIST1H4A are histone variants; H2AFZ is a replacement for the canonical histone H2A and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. HIST1H4A is a core component of the nucleosome, and its post-translational modifications are critical for transcriptional regulation.

4. HNRNPD (also known as AUF1) is an RNA-binding protein that influences mRNA stability and turnover, thereby indirectly affecting gene expression.

5. KAT6A and TERT are involved in modifying chromatin structure and telomere maintenance, respectively. KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase that can regulate transcription through chromatin remodeling. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, can also regulate gene expression independently of its role in telomere elongation.

6. MTA3, PML, TBL1XR1, and TNF are involved in various aspects of chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation. MTA3 is a component of the NuRD complex, like CHD3, and is involved in gene silencing. PML is involved in the formation of nuclear bodies and can regulate transcription. TBL1XR1 is part of the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex, which mediates transcriptional repression. TNF is primarily known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine but can also influence gene expression through activation of NF-kB.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure and transcription. They work in concert to modulate gene expression patterns necessary for various cellular processes, including development, metabolism, immune response, and maintenance of genomic integrity. The interplay between these proteins facilitates the precise and context-dependent regulation of transcription, ensuring proper cellular function and response to environmental cues."	0.92	0	13/557	8.760463572270381e-16	5.224062971351985e-13	CREBBP;ACTL6A;CHD3;TNF;RELA;RUNX1;YY1;TBL1XR1;KAT6A;HNRNPD;EP300;MTA3;TP53	Positive Regulation Of Nucleic Acid-Templated Transcription (GO:1903508)	Positive Regulation Of Nucleic Acid-Templated Transcription 	GO:1903508	MED1 EGF MED4 ZNF281 GATAD2A RFX3 TRIP4 SOX10 GATAD2B PHF5A COL1A1 CD4 PSMC5 IL31RA RFX6 HNRNPD SKAP1 LEF1 SF3B5 ZNF398 SF3B3 TRRAP SCX GPATCH3 PRKAA1 RNF6 RNF4 IFNL1 PSMD9 MTA1 TFPT MTA2 MYB ZMIZ1 CREB3L2 NUP85 MSANTD1 MYC TP53INP2 AKT1 NKX2-1 MTA3 PPARGC1A NKX2-5 HES5 RNF111 FZD2 NFE2 CREBBP FZD1 FZD4 AFAP1L2 ACTL6A FZD7 INO80 NR1D1 NR2F2 PBX4 NR0B2 NR1D2 FLI1 HCFC1 MLLT11 MMS19 SNAI1 ATF4 ATF5 HLA-DRB1 FANK1 ZNF496 PHB1 AIRE MEAF6 BCL10 GATA6 PDGFB GATA4 TMEM98 XPC ELK1 GATA3 HIF1A GATA1 MRPL12 ZXDA EDRF1 SOX18 ZXDC NUP62 SOX17 CDK5RAP2 NKX3-1 MYBL1 SUPT20H ALX1 JUN MCRS1 TESC NFATC2 NFATC1 PAX6 PAX3 PAX2 TAF6L KAT2B KAT2A TADA2B PAX8 TAL1 RARA CRLF3 RET PHF20 NR1I2 MESP1 PRDM16 CTCF HOXC13 MED17 MED16 PRDM11 MED13 MED12 TAF5L MED14 SHH MECOM ATXN7 WBP2NL TASP1 TEAD1 TEAD2 ATAD2 BRD4 ANKRD49 MEF2C PPARA STAT1 MBD2 NR1H3 STAT3 MBD3 NR1H2 FOS WNT7A GTF2H1 NR1H4 RYBP NFIB PPARG UBE2V1 MYRF PPARD PLCB1 KDM8 SETD3 CDKN1C TGFB1I1 GLI2 ING1 PHF8 GLI1 ING2 GLI3 IKBKB ING3 SPIN1 BRD8 NFRKB BRPF1 BICRAL ZBTB16 MITF HIPK2 HNRNPAB ILF2 AGT ILF3 FOXP3 HINFP MORF4L1 MORF4L2 WT1 YEATS4 KAT6B KAT6A ZNF318 NCF1 PHIP RNF187 MAD2L2 EPO KARS1 CREBL2 AHR TNF EGFR FOXO3 NPAS2 NPAS3 FOXO1 RUVBL1 YY1 HMGN5 NSD1 CDH1 NSD3 RBBP4 RUVBL2 HAS3 RBBP7 SPP1 PITX3 ZNF423 MAP3K5 KCNH2 ESRRB MAP2K2 MAP2K3 F2R MAP2K1 DYRK1B DYRK1A MAFB NFKB1 LHX3 LHX2 MED22 MLXIPL TADA3 LHX1 INO80B MAP3K12 INO80D INO80C KMT2E NOTCH4 MAX NOTCH1 BLM CALCOCO1 INO80E KMT2B MAZ KMT2A RORB RORC FGF2 FOXM1 RORA GLIS2 FGF7 SALL1 VPS72 MED30 NDP PIM2 ZKSCAN3 NEK4 MAP2K7 CTCFL ACTR8 DTX3L ACTR5 PYHIN1 MSL3 EDF1 FOXL2 MSL1 MSL2 DNAJC2 BCL3 ZNF516 OGT ENY2 DLX5 SHC1 BMP10 MLLT1 FOXK2 FOXK1 MLLT3 LBH NPAT DVL3 RREB1 CEP290 CIITA TRIM44 SMARCC1 TBX1 SMARCC2 IRX6 CHUK KLF1 TP53INP1 KLF4 TBX5 KLF2 RNF20 ZFP90 LBHD1 PPM1A KLF6 RNF10 CEBPB SMARCD3 HDAC4 HDAC1 RNF14 ZBTB48 HDAC2 WDR5 CXXC1 HHEX SRY TNNI2 PCBD2 SOST YAF2 TRIM28 INSL3 ACVR1 SS18L1 SMARCA1 CNBP FOXH1 RUNX1 PSG1 SMARCA2 JMJD6 RUNX3 SMARCA4 RUNX2 NIF3L1 TFAM TRIM16 ZNF711 TP53 WBP2 SP100 LRP6 LRP5 SFRP1 CHEK2 E2F1 APBB1 TBL1X ATXN7L3 BTRC EGR1 EGR2 FOXF2 XRCC6 FOXF1 GDF2 IGF1 HNF1B GDF7 GDF6 TRERF1 UCHL5 TP73 HNF1A DXO CASZ1 FOXE1 SOX4 SOX2 KAT5 MBTD1 EPC1 INPP5K EPC2 APOE KAT8 SOX9 TP53BP1 HIVEP3 SOX8 TP63 IL10 NCOA1 NCOA6 ATMIN TFEB RHOG NME2 RGMB SUPT3H NR5A2 IL1B TFAP4 FUBP3 ID2 CAMK4 MSTN BMAL1 BMAL2 ACVRL1 FOXC2 CITED1 FOXC1 CITED2 BRCA1 BRCA2 PPP3CB SNX5 SEC14L2 HNF4A TFE3 CD38 NFIL3 NEUROD1 ARNT2 NPM1 PRMT2 PARP9 WAC AZF1 MAPRE3 NEUROG3 FOXA2 AKR1B1 CTNNB1 SGF29 RSF1 CAMKK2 SERTAD3 EP300 FAM170A NFYA TFAP2B TGFB1 EOMES CD74 TGFB3 FBXW11 OSR2 WNT5A SUPT7L MYCN TBL1XR1 BAMBI TFAP2A CD86 RELA YAP1 CD80 TAF1L ATOH8 HOXA11 RXRA RXRB TBX21 CAPN3 EP400 DMAP1 NIBAN2 SMAD3 ARHGEF11 SMAD2 SMAD5 POU3F1 SMAD4 WNT3A PCID2 INHBA ESR1 MRGBP ESR2 POU3F3 PICALM CREB1 MDFIC TCF4 TCF3 CREB5 GCM1 NAT14 PSEN1 ETS1 DEAF1 ZFHX3 MYOCD USP22 HMGA2 AXIN1 MT3 HMGA1 TGFBR1 BMP7 DNM2 BMP4 ELF1 IL4 IRF1 ELF2 BMP2 IL6 ELF4 IRF4 THRAP3 IRF6 IRF7 QRICH1 KDM5A RBM23 ILK CHD8 CHD4 HMGB2 CHD3 WNT11 ERBB4 OTX2 WNT1 WNT4 YWHAH ATF7IP TAF15 TAF12 TAF10 ARID1A ARID1B PSRC1 KANSL2 KANSL3 REST PITHD1 NAA15 TAF9 DDIT3 TAF7 NAA16 TAF6 TAF5 TAF4 ZP3 CLOCK TAF2 KDM3A USP16 SIX1 KANSL1 MYRFL BICRA LYL1 CAND2 RPS6KA1 ZIC3 ZIC1 SFR1 SIX4 ZIC2 VHL NOS1	0.41297647	0.023008849557522124	0.6190476190476191	True	False

These proteins often serve as substrate adaptors or regulators for CRLs, which are responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins.

2. The KLHL (Kelch-like) family members, including KLHL2, KLHL3, KLHL12, KLHL22, and KLHL25, typically contain BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac) domains that facilitate the formation of CRL complexes by interacting with Cullin proteins and RING-box proteins. They are implicated in various cellular processes through the targeted degradation of proteins.

3. The KCTD (Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain containing) proteins, such as KCTD9 and KCTD11, also contain BTB domains and are involved in the assembly and regulation of CRL complexes. They contribute to the specificity of the ubiquitination process by recognizing and binding to specific substrates.

4. RHOBTB2 and RHOBTB3 are atypical members of the Rho family and have been implicated in the regulation of CRL3 complexes. They may act as adaptors or regulators within these complexes, influencing the ubiquitination of various proteins.

5. WNK (With No lysine (K)) kinases, including WNK1, WNK2, WNK3, and WNK4, are a family of serine/threonine-protein kinases that do not directly interact with CRL complexes but are known to be involved in the regulation of ion transport and signaling pathways. Their activity can be modulated by ubiquitination, suggesting a potential indirect link with the CRL system through regulation of kinase activity or stability.

6. SHKBP1 acts as an adaptor that links WNK kinases to the CRL3 complex, suggesting a coordinated regulation of WNK kinase activity and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes, which play a critical role in protein turnover and cellular homeostasis. The WNK kinases, while not directly part of the CRL complexes, are subject to regulation by ubiquitination, which may be facilitated by the action of the other proteins in this system. The interplay between these proteins ensures precise control of protein degradation, affecting various cellular processes."	0.85	0	3/35	2.706521044287566e-06	0.0004168042408202	WNK1;WNK3;WNK4	Regulation Of Sodium Ion Transport (GO:0002028)	Regulation Of Sodium Ion Transport 	GO:0002028	ATP2B4 ANK3 CNKSR3 DLG1 P2RX7 P2RX4 WNK1 PER1 WNK3 NEDD4 SLMAP WNK4 GPD1L PKP2 SCN4B SIK1 FGF12 RANGRF SPTBN4 NEDD4L ATP1A1 NKAIN3 NKAIN2 BPIFA1 NKAIN4 PRSS8 SCN5A NOS1 DRD2 NKX2-5 SCN3B NKAIN1 SNTA1 YWHAH SCN1B	0.2689545	0.0625	0.1875	True	False

BLNK, NCK1, NCK2, SH3KBP1, SH3YL1, SHB, SORBS2, SORBS3, and WASL are adaptor proteins that contain SH2 and SH3 domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions that regulate signal transduction pathways. These proteins often link receptor tyrosine kinases and other membrane receptors to actin cytoskeletal rearrangements.

3. CD2AP, FNBP1, FNBP1L, and TRIP10 are involved in membrane trafficking and endocytosis. They interact with components of the actin cytoskeleton and play roles in the formation of endocytic complexes, which are essential for the internalization and recycling of membrane receptors.

4. GAS7 and WIPF3 are involved in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, which are protrusive structures that contribute to cell motility and are regulated by the actin cytoskeleton.

5. SLC2A1 and SLC2A4, also known as GLUT1 and GLUT4, are glucose transporters that facilitate the uptake of glucose across the plasma membrane. Their trafficking to and from the cell surface is regulated by insulin signaling and involves interactions with the actin cytoskeleton.

6. SMPDL3B, STAM, STAM2, and VAV2, VAV3 are involved in endosomal sorting and signaling. STAM and STAM2 are part of the ESCRT-0 complex, which is involved in the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation. VAV proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho family GTPases, which are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton.

7. SYNJ2 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that plays a role in endocytosis and the recycling of synaptic vesicles, which is also linked to actin dynamics.

8. UNC50 is involved in the Golgi-to-endosome transport and may play a role in the trafficking of proteins that are important for actin cytoskeleton regulation.

9. PEX13 is a component of the peroxisomal membrane and is involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. While not directly related to actin cytoskeleton or membrane trafficking, peroxisomes can interact with the cytoskeleton for positioning within the cell.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. These processes are essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling cell movement, and regulating the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins. The interplay between these proteins facilitates the dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton and the precise control of membrane protein localization, which is critical for cellular responsiveness to external signals."	0.92	0	4/20	2.567339763686358e-08	4.550789880013026e-06	VAV3;YES1;SRC;VAV2	Fc-gamma Receptor Signaling Pathway Involved In Phagocytosis (GO:0038096)	Fc-gamma Receptor Signaling Pathway Involved In Phagocytosis 	GO:0038096	YES1 LYN SRC LIMK1 PRKCD SYK PRKCE PLA2G6 PLD2 VAV1 HCK VAV2 PTK2 VAV3 FGR FCGR2B PAK1 FYN PLPP4 MYO1G	0.41375017	0.08333333333333333	0.125	True	False

3. SENP3 is a SUMO-specific protease involved in the deSUMOylation process, which can indirectly affect ubiquitination pathways by altering the SUMOylation status of proteins that are also targets for ubiquitination.

4. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins and the stabilization of a number of client proteins, many of which are involved in signal transduction and protection against stress. It can interact with the UPS by stabilizing proteins before they are ubiquitinated or by refolding ubiquitinated proteins that have been targeted for degradation.

5. TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction. It can influence the UPS by promoting the degradation of IκB, leading to the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses.

6. UBXN1 and UBXN7 are members of the UBX domain-containing protein family, which can interact with the p97/VCP segregase, a protein involved in the extraction of ubiquitinated proteins from membranes or protein complexes in preparation for their degradation by the proteasome.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein quality control, regulation of cell cycle, and various signaling pathways. Additionally, they play roles in the cellular stress response, particularly in the context of protein folding and inflammation. The system exhibits a high degree of functional integration, with multiple proteins contributing to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, as well as the regulation of these processes through chaperoning and deSUMOylation."	0.89	0	5/220	4.224367723956872e-07	0.0001668625250962	UBXN1;MDM2;UBXN7;DCAF11;CUL4B	Proteasomal Protein Catabolic Process (GO:0010498)	Proteasomal Protein Catabolic Process 	GO:0010498	ATE1 PEX10 ARMC8 PEX12 PML PSMC6 APC PSMC4 IFI27 PSMC5 PSMC2 PSMC3 NHLRC1 PSMC1 RBCK1 NHLRC3 ASB2 TRIM13 RNF5 RNF4 FBXL22 MTA1 PSMD7 PSMD8 PSMD6 PSMD3 PSMD4 PSMD1 PSMD2 TBL1X BTRC RFFL SIAH1 XBP1 SIAH3 SIAH2 NR1D1 TOPORS PSME4 ATF6 NEDD4L KAT5 RNF216 PCBP2 SKP1 SKP2 CSNK1A1 SIRT1 SIRT2 UBE2G1 KBTBD6 KBTBD7 PRPF19 BMAL1 UBXN1 WDR26 ZFAND2A SEL1L ZFAND2B KIF14 TRIM2 TRIM9 ANKRD9 ATXN3 SH3BGRL UCHL1 TRIM3 UBXN7 SOCS6 UBXN6 APC2 WWP1 SYVN1 UBE4B WWP2 ITCH GID4 PSMA6 SPSB4 DDB1 PSMA7 SPSB3 PSMA4 SPSB2 PSMA5 RNF126 SPSB1 GID8 PSMA2 PSMA3 PSMA1 PELI1 TRIP12 RNF122 FAF1 CTNNB1 DERL1 PSMA8 PSMB7 PRAMEF6 PSMB5 PSMB6 PSMB3 PSMB4 RNF139 ENC1 PSMB1 PSMB2 PRAME ZSWIM8 PRAMEF9 MARCHF6 FBXW5 KLHDC3 FBXW7 FBXW11 CRBN KLHDC2 KLHL22 UBE2A UBE2B KLHL20 RBX1 RNF41 NSFL1C UBE2W TBL1XR1 UBXN11 DNAJB12 RNF185 RNF187 UBE2K RNF186 PLAA PRKN RNF34 UBE3D UBXN2B UBE2D3 UBXN2A PCNP TBX21 SPOP USP44 APPBP2 RCAN3 BIRC2 MDM2 TRIM72 BRSK2 VCP CUL3 TRIM71 CUL1 MAEA SEL1L2 RHOBTB3 BAG6 COP1 PMAIP1 SMURF2 SMURF1 RHBDD1 AXIN2 PPP2R5C AXIN1 RAD23B BFAR RAD23A PJA2 CUL4B CUL4A SPOPL NFE2L2 PSMD11 GSK3B PSMD13 GSK3A PSMD12 PSMD14 AGAP3 LOC122513141 TNFAIP1 DTX4 FBXO44 FBXO45 SHARPIN ERLEC1 DDI2 DDI1 FEM1B FEM1C FBXL19 KCTD2 FBXL17 KCTD5 KLHL42 CDC34 KCTD10 ERCC8 DDIT3 KCTD13 STUB1 CLOCK KCTD17 CCDC47 ARRB2 AMBRA1 TNFSF13B ZNRF1 ZNRF2 HECTD1 RMND5A RMND5B HECTD3 ARRB1 FBXO7 DCAF11 FBXO9 TRIM21	0.50631064	0.021739130434782608	0.3333333333333333	True	False

ATF1, ATF4, CREB1, and CREM are members of the Activating Transcription Factor (ATF)/cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB) protein family. These transcription factors can form homo- or heterodimers and bind to cAMP response elements (CRE) in DNA, regulating the transcription of genes in response to hormonal and stress signals. ATF4 is particularly known for its role in the cellular stress response, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), and amino acid metabolism.

2. BATF and JDP2 are basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. BATF forms dimers with Jun proteins and is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and differentiation of immune cells. JDP2 represses transcription by forming inactive complexes with other transcription factors and is implicated in cellular stress response mechanisms.

3. CEBPG (also known as C/EBP gamma) is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and functions as a transcriptional regulator involved in cell cycle and metabolism. It can act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of other C/EBP family members.

4. DDIT3 (also known as CHOP) is a transcription factor induced by cellular stress, particularly during the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. It is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and can heterodimerize with ATF4.

5. GABBR1 and GABBR2 encode the subunits of the GABA(B) receptor, which is involved in neurotransmission. While not directly related to transcriptional regulation, their interaction with the system could suggest a role in cellular signaling pathways that influence gene expression.

6. GOLGA1 (also known as golgin A1) is involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and may play a role in the trafficking of proteins that are crucial for transcriptional regulation.

7. JAKMIP1 (Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1) is associated with microtubules and may be involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene expression.

8. MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein) is a transcription factor that can bind to G/C-rich DNA sequences and is implicated in gene expression regulation and DNA repair.

9. POU6F1 (POU class 6 homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that may play a role in the development of the nervous system and in the regulation of gene expression.

10. UTF1 (Undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1) is associated with maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and may regulate gene expression during early development.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to cellular stress and developmental signals. They include transcription factors that respond to stress, regulate metabolism, and control developmental processes. The presence of GABA(B) receptor subunits suggests a potential link to signal transduction pathways that modulate the activity of these transcription factors. The system appears to be functionally integrated around the regulation of gene expression in response to various intracellular and extracellular stimuli, with a significant emphasis on the cellular stress response."	0.92	0	11/1922	1.7378905059273052e-08	2.921302065843115e-06	ATF1;CREB1;DDIT3;MAZ;CEBPG;CREM;UTF1;JDP2;BATF;POU6F1;ATF4	Regulation Of DNA-templated Transcription
