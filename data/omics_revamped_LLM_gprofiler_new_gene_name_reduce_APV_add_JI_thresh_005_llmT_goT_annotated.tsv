ACAA1 (Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1) and ACOX1 (Acyl-CoA oxidase 1) are key enzymes in the beta-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids within peroxisomes. ACAA1 catalyzes the last step of the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, while ACOX1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step.||||2. C6orf226 is a less characterized protein, but its association with peroxisomal proteins suggests a role in peroxisomal function or biogenesis.||||3. CAT (Catalase) is a peroxisomal marker enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of fatty acid beta-oxidation, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage.||||4. DDO (D-aspartate oxidase) and DECR2 (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 2) are involved in the catabolism of D-amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids, respectively, processes that occur within peroxisomes.||||5. HSD17B4 (Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4) is a multifunctional enzyme that also participates in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation.||||6. PEX5L (Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5-like), PEX6, PEX16, and PEX26 are all members of the peroxins family, which are proteins involved in the biogenesis and maintenance of peroxisomes. PEX5L is a variant of PEX5 and is involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. PEX6, PEX16, and PEX26 are involved in the assembly of the peroxisomal membrane and the import of matrix proteins.||||7. PSMB1 (Proteasome subunit beta type-1) is a component of the proteasome, which is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. While not a peroxisomal protein, its presence in the system may be related to the degradation of misfolded or unnecessary peroxisomal proteins.||||8. SLC25A17 (Solute carrier family 25 member 17) is a peroxisomal membrane protein that functions as a transporter, potentially involved in the import of cofactors or export of metabolites.||||In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in peroxisomal functions, including fatty acid metabolism, detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, and catabolism of D-amino acids. The presence of multiple peroxins indicates a strong emphasis on peroxisomal biogenesis and maintenance. The inclusion of PSMB1 suggests a link to protein quality control mechanisms, possibly related to peroxisomal dynamics. The system reflects a coordinated network of proteins that maintain peroxisomal integrity and metabolic functions.	0.94	peroxisome organization	GO:0007031	5.127465749420131e-09	5	39	12	ACOX1,PEX5L,PEX6,PEX16,PEX26	0.108695652173913	0.4166666666666667	ACAA1 ACOX1 CAT HSD17B4 PEX5L PEX6 PEX16 PEX26 SLC25A17	9.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are directly involved in peroxisomal functions, including fatty acid metabolism, detoxification, and biogenesis.

CERS2 (Ceramide Synthase 2), CERS4 (Ceramide Synthase 4), CERS5 (Ceramide Synthase 5), and CERS6 (Ceramide Synthase 6) are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of ceramides. They catalyze the formation of ceramide from sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoA, which is a central step in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Each of these enzymes has specificity for acyl-CoA of different chain lengths, contributing to the diversity of ceramide species in membranes.||||3. FA2H (Fatty Acid 2-Hydroxylase) is involved in the hydroxylation of sphingolipid and fatty acid components of myelin. This modification is important for the stability and function of myelin sheaths in the nervous system.||||4. PFDN2 (Prefoldin Subunit 2) is part of the prefoldin complex, which is involved in the folding of proteins upon their synthesis. While not directly related to sphingolipid metabolism, proper protein folding is essential for the function of all enzymes, including those involved in lipid metabolism.||||5. SLC36A1 (Solute Carrier Family 36 Member 1) is a proton-coupled amino acid transporter.

Several proteins in this system are directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis. DHCR7, FDFT1, and MSMO1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. DHCR7 catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, FDFT1 is involved in the first committed step of sterol synthesis, and MSMO1 is responsible for the conversion of methylsterol intermediates to cholesterol.||||2. INSIG1 and LDLR are critical in cholesterol regulation. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. LDLR is a cell-surface receptor responsible for the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is a primary mechanism for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream.||||3. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fats are components of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides, and they play a role in the fluidity and function of biological membranes, which can indirectly affect cholesterol metabolism.||||4. The presence of other proteins such as PXDN and CLDN10, which are involved in extracellular matrix formation and tight junctions respectively, suggests additional roles in tissue organization and integrity, which may be related to the broader context of cholesterol metabolism and its impact on cellular structures.||||5. Proteins like TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2) indicate a connection to signaling pathways that can influence cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which may intersect with cholesterol metabolism in complex ways, such as in the regulation of cell growth and the synthesis of membrane components.||||To summarize, the prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is centered around cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation. The system includes enzymes directly involved in the production of cholesterol, proteins that regulate its synthesis and uptake, and factors that may influence or be influenced by cholesterol metabolism in the context of cell signaling and structural integrity. The confidence score reflects that while a significant number of proteins are involved in cholesterol-related processes, there are additional proteins with functions that are not directly related to cholesterol but may be part of broader cellular contexts in which cholesterol plays a role.	0.85	cholesterol biosynthetic process	GO:0006695	0.0003506232798447	4	54	28	COL5A1,FAP,FDFT1,LDLR	0.0512820512820512	0.1428571428571428	DHCR7 FDFT1 MSMO1 INSIG1 LDLR	5.0	-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Regulation because they are directly involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol.

Several proteins in this system, including DNAJB9, DNAJC10, DNAJC3, EDEM1, EIF2AK3, HSP90B1, and PDIA4, are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and protein folding. These proteins function as chaperones, foldases, and components of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER.||||2. The UPR is a cellular stress response related to the ER and is involved in the quality control of protein folding. Key elements of this response include the upregulation of molecular chaperones (HSP90B1, DNAJB9) and enzymes that facilitate protein folding (PDIA4), as well as signaling pathways that lead to the reduction of protein synthesis and enhancement of degradation pathways to restore ER homeostasis.||||3. EIF2AK3, also known as PERK, is a kinase that phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis, which helps to alleviate the protein load on the ER. DDIT3 and DDIT4 are transcription factors that are upregulated during ER stress and contribute to the UPR by regulating genes involved in apoptosis and metabolism.||||4. Proteins such as SEC24D and SEC31A are part of the COPII vesicle coat complex and are involved in the ER-to-Golgi transport of proteins, which is essential for proper protein sorting and maturation.||||5. The presence of proteins like INSIG1 and SREBP (not listed but related to INSIG1 function) indicates a connection to lipid metabolism and the regulation of cholesterol synthesis, which is also linked to ER function and stress.||||6. The protein folding environment is further supported by the presence of numerous chaperones and foldases, such as CALU, HSPA13, and SERP1, which assist in the proper folding and maturation of nascent polypeptides.||||7.

NeST	Cluster2-185	Cluster2-185	AKAP13 KSR1 PRKACG	AKAP13 KSR1 PRKACG	3	cAMP-Dependent Signaling Modulation	1. AKAP13, also known as A-kinase anchor protein 13, is a scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of multiprotein complexes. It is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including those mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). AKAP13 anchors PKA to specific subcellular locations, facilitating localized signal transduction and ensuring that the kinase is in proximity to its substrates.||||2. KSR1, or Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1, functions as a scaffold protein that facilitates the assembly of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase module, a key signaling pathway involved in cell growth and differentiation. While not directly involved in cAMP signaling, KSR1 interacts with components of the MAPK pathway, which can be modulated by cAMP levels through cross-talk between signaling pathways.||||3. PRKACG represents the gamma catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. PKA is a tetrameric holoenzyme composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits and is activated upon binding to cAMP. Once activated, PKA phosphorylates a variety of substrates, leading to changes in cell function. The gamma subunit of PKA is one of the catalytic subunits that, upon cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits, is released to phosphorylate target proteins.||||The proteins in this system are involved in the modulation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. AKAP13 and PRKACG are directly associated with the PKA signaling axis, with AKAP13 anchoring PKA to specific locations and PRKACG being a part of the PKA enzyme itself. KSR1, while primarily associated with the MAPK pathway, can be influenced by PKA activity, suggesting a potential for cross-talk and integration between these signaling pathways. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated regulation of cellular responses to cAMP, which is a second messenger involved in a multitude of cellular processes such as metabolism, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression.	0.89	adenylate cyclase-activating adrenergic receptor signaling pathway involved in heart process	GO:0086023	0.0479041812935361	1	4	3	AKAP13	0.1666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	AKAP13 PRKACG	2.0	-- Summary --||The gene set cAMP-Dependent Signaling Modulation is supported by the roles of AKAP13 and PRKACG in cAMP-dependent signaling pathways.

OXCT1 and OXCT2, 3-oxoacid CoA-transferases 1 and 2, are enzymes involved in ketone body metabolism. Their direct role in hair follicle development is not evident, but they may contribute to the energy metabolism within the highly proliferative hair follicle cells.||||9. PADI3, Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase 3, is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins by converting arginine residues to citrulline. PADI3 is crucial for hair shaft formation, and mutations can lead to hair structure abnormalities.||||10.
