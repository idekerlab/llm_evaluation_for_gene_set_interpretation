The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Protein Homeostasis"" as they are involved in various aspects of cellular stress responses, including mRNA processing, protein synthesis and degradation, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression. These functions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions.

-- Explanation --
RNMT: High
RNMT is involved in mRNA cap methylation, crucial for mRNA stability and efficient translation, especially under stress conditions.

SAMD9L: Medium
SAMD9L is implicated in the innate immune response and cellular stress responses, potentially regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis.

CEBPB: High
CEBPB functions as a transcription factor regulating genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, particularly under stress conditions.

CEBPG: High
CEBPG, like CEBPB, is a transcription factor regulating genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, particularly under stress conditions.

PSMD12: High
PSMD12 is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, essential for maintaining protein homeostasis during cellular stress.

RSRC2: Medium
RSRC2 influences RNA splicing and stability, critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during stress responses.

HNRNPA1: Medium
HNRNPA1 influences RNA splicing and stability, critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during stress responses.

XBP1: High
XBP1 is a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response, activated in response to ER stress to restore normal function.

GADD45A: High
GADD45A is involved in the response to environmental stress and DNA damage, playing a role in growth arrest and apoptosis.

USP28: Medium
USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme regulating the stability of proteins involved in the DNA damage response and other stress response pathways.
