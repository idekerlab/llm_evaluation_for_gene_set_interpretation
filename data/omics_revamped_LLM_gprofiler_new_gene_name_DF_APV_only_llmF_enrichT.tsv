It is activated by its ligand, Macrophage Stimulating Protein (MSP), and is implicated in wound healing, immune responses, and potentially in the invasive growth of cancer cells. MST1R signaling can lead to the activation of various pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, and the JAK/STAT pathway, which are critical for cell proliferation and survival.

2. PRPF31 is a component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA. It is involved in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing, which is a crucial process for the generation of mature, translatable mRNA molecules. Mutations in PRPF31 are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, indicating its importance in the maintenance of retinal cell function.

3. SUB1, also known as PC4, is a multifunctional protein that has roles in transcriptional coactivation, DNA repair, and the regulation of transcriptional elongation. It binds to single-stranded DNA and interacts with RNA polymerase II, influencing the transcription of specific genes. SUB1 is also implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage and is involved in maintaining genome stability.

To summarize, the proteins MST1R, PRPF31, and SUB1 are involved in distinct biological processes: MST1R in cell signaling and growth regulation, PRPF31 in mRNA processing, and SUB1 in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair.

However, zinc finger proteins are a large family with diverse functions and target genes, making it difficult to assign a single biological process to this group without additional context.

Other proteins in the list, such as SLC39A6 and SLC39A10, are members of the solute carrier family and are involved in metal ion transport. Their functions are critical for cellular metal homeostasis but are not directly related to the functions of zinc finger proteins.

Proteins like EPM2AIP1, TBC1D19, and TPGS1 have roles in various cellular processes including mRNA processing, intracellular trafficking, and protein transport, respectively. These functions, while essential to cellular operation, do not suggest a common biological process shared with the other proteins in the list.

TTC23, TTLL1, and MYSM1 are involved in processes such as tubulin modification, histone demethylation, and gene expression regulation. Again, these are important cellular functions but do not align under a single biological process with the other proteins mentioned.

NICN1, PGBD1, and LRRC49, along with the zinc finger proteins ZKSCAN1, ZKSCAN8, ZSCAN1, and ZSCAN21, are involved in various aspects of nucleic acid binding and regulation, but they do not appear to converge on a specific, shared biological pathway based on the information provided.

2. Some proteins are involved in signal transduction and immune responses (CXCR4, IL6, CCL2), while others are implicated in metabolic processes (LDHA, ACHE, GYG1).

3. Several proteins have roles in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (CDC7, WEE1, FOXM1), whereas others are involved in neuronal development and function (NELL2, PDYN, PCP4L1).

4. A few proteins are associated with specific diseases or conditions, such as NPC2 with Niemann-Pick disease and G6PC3 with severe congenital neutropenia.

5. There are proteins that are less characterized or have unknown functions (LOC100128002, KIAA1377), which further complicates the identification of a common biological process.

6. The list includes proteins that are part of the ribosomal machinery (RPL22, RPL38) and protein synthesis (EIF3E, NAA10), but these do not represent a majority of the system.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear majority of proteins participating in a single, coherent biological process, it is appropriate to conclude that this system does not revolve around a central biological theme. Therefore, the most accurate description for this group of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the absence of a unifying biological process. The confidence score assigned to this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a prominent biological process within this system."	0.0	protein deglycation	GO:0036525	0.0421228604116835	2	2	87	TPPP,RPL38	0.022988505747126436	0.022988505747126436						False	True

For example, TSPEAR is associated with Notch signaling and development, SST is a hormone that inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones, PAX6 is a key regulatory gene in eye and neural development, and METTL3 is involved in mRNA methylation, impacting RNA stability and translation.

2. Proteins like SETMAR, ZMIZ1, and SMAD7 are implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, respectively. These proteins play roles in maintaining genomic integrity, regulating gene expression, and modulating cell signaling pathways.

3. Proteins such as GNG3 (a G protein subunit), KIF2C (a kinesin involved in mitosis), and STK3 (a serine/threonine kinase) are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and apoptosis, which are fundamental cellular processes but not indicative of a unified biological process within this system.

4. Transport and trafficking proteins like SLC19A2 (a thiamine transporter), MAGOH (involved in mRNA splicing and export), and ABCA6 (a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family) highlight the diversity of functions related to cellular transport mechanisms present in this system.

5. Proteins such as FERMT1 and ACTR6 are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, respectively, which are critical for cellular structure and motility but do not suggest a common biological process for the system.

6. The presence of non-coding RNA genes like MORC2-AS1 and THAP7-AS1 indicates regulatory roles at the RNA level, adding another layer of functional diversity to the system.

7. The inclusion of proteins with poorly characterized functions or those represented by locus names (e.g., LOC100131929, C1ORF213) further complicates the identification of a unified biological process.

The lack of a unifying theme or process among these proteins leads to the conclusion that this is a system of unrelated proteins."	0.0	meiotic spindle organization	GO:0000212	0.0236165784271766	2	19	11	RBM22,LOC100131150	0.07142857142857142	0.18181818181818182						False	True

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and molecular functions, including but not limited to:

1. Structural components (e.g., KRT80, a keratin involved in the structural integrity of epithelial cells).
2. Transcription factors and gene regulation (e.g., POU2F2, which plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in the immune system and development).
3. Enzymatic activity in metabolic pathways (e.g., ALDH1B1, an aldehyde dehydrogenase involved in retinoic acid biosynthesis).
4. Signal transduction (e.g., NFKBIA, an inhibitor of the NF-kappa-B pathway).
5. Transport proteins (e.g., SLC22A15, a solute carrier family protein).
6. Cell cycle and division (e.g., ANAPC10, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex).
7. DNA and RNA processing (e.g., DDX19A, a DEAD-box RNA helicase involved in mRNA export from the nucleus).

Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying theme or pathway that they are all significantly involved in, it is not possible to assign a specific biological process that is prominently performed by this system. The proteins listed participate in a multitude of processes that are essential for various cellular functions, but they do not collectively represent a coherent system dedicated to a single biological process.

Therefore, the most accurate description for this set of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the broad spectrum of unrelated functions they serve within the cell. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a single, prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins."	0.0	DNA-templated transcription	GO:0006351	0.035341383219206	31	3569	92	TGFB3,RFX6,ZNF681,GTF2F2,NSD3,POU2F2,NFKBIA,INHBA,USP15,ABHD14B,NFIC,UFL1,OTX1,PPHLN1,CTBP1,GTF3C6,MRPL12,ZNF484,ZNF584,ZNF721,MED13L,PELP1,TNNI2,LCORL,POU2AF2,DPF3,ALX4,DCN,ZNF597,RBL1,HAPLN3	0.008539944903581268	0.33695652173913043						False	True
