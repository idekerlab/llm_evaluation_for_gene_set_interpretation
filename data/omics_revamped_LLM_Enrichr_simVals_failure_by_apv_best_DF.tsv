FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.

3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.

4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.

5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.

6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.

7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses."	0.88	0	16/705	4.800638292211621e-09	4.301371909821612e-06	PRR7;BEX1;ASNS;FOXO3;RHOB;DNAJA1;SFRP1;BCL6;CASP6;MYC;FLNA;MNDA;ATF5;SKP2;PHLDA1;HSPA1A	Regulation Of Apoptotic Process (GO:0042981)	Regulation Of Apoptotic Process 	GO:0042981	MED1 LACRT PRELID1 UNC13B BAD WDR73 SCRIB DKK1 USP17L3 USP17L4 USP17L1 USP17L2 HNRNPK IL31RA HSPA1A TEK YME1L1 BAX CIAPIN1 TNFSF9 VIP HSPA1B LEF1 PRKAA2 ANKLE2 TRRAP RPL10 SCX NUGGC ARAF PRKAA1 ASCL1 SPDEF USP17L7 USP17L8 PRAP1 TFPT USP17L5 MYC AKT1 AKT2 CYP1B1 NKX2-6 NKX2-5 PROK2 SNCA ZNF268 HOXA5 TAF9B KLF11 PLK5 SIGMAR1 GPLD1 WNT10B ZBTB7A PRKCI PLK1 NCKAP1L TSLP ACTL6A PLK3 PLK2 FZD9 ZNF16 SUPV3L1 LATS2 LATS1 MLLT11 SETX PLSCR3 BIN1 KCNMA1 PPT1 ATF6 CRYAB ATF4 ATF5 CRYAA FANK1 PHB2 PHB1 HPN MEAF6 TFRC BCL10 GATA6 PRKDC SLC6A2 GATA1 PRDX3 DSTYK PRDX5 PRDX2 FIGNL1 MLST8 NUP62 MYO18A ATG7 IER3 BARD1 DUSP6 ANXA1 JUN ANXA4 RIPK3 ANXA5 SPHK2 SPHK1 AZU1 PAX7 BRAF SIRT1 PAWR PAX2 PAX8 GAS1 GAS6 ARF4 HRK TRIM2 MTDH RNF157 BCLAF1 SHH CTLA4 PLEKHN1 RIPK1 EGLN2 DFFA EGLN3 MEF2C MGMT STAT1 NR1H4 RRP1B SEPTIN4 DHRS2 SERPINB9 DAB2IP CLIP3 RYBP APEX1 ANGPTL4 FABP1 RNF122 PHLPP1 RARG HTT GSTP1 FMN2 FSTL1 ING5 ING3 ING4 AIFM2 ADAMTSL4 TCTN3 AIFM1 SMPD1 HS1BP3 NME2P1 PRAME RACK1 RICTOR BRD8 JAK3 TMEM14A BID AREL1 BIK PHLDA1 RPS6 SEMA4D FBXO11 AGT FBXO10 HIPK3 COPS5 CXCL10 MORF4L1 OLFM1 MORF4L2 MELK WT1 OLFM4 PINK1 IAPP YEATS4 PDCD5 FKBP8 IL6ST PDCD2 PHIP MRE11 SQSTM1 PTPN6 TARDBP MAD2L1 VTCN1 CLU PARK7 TNF EGFR FOXO3 HSP90B1 FOXO1 RUVBL1 PYCARD BCL2L11 FRZB HMGN5 DDRGK1 BCL2L10 NTF3 RUVBL2 CFL1 FLNA SAP18 RPS3 PHLDA3 MAP3K5 C8ORF17 WFS1 BNIP3L IGFBP3 TNFRSF10D TNFRSF10C TNFRSF10B TNFRSF10A TRAF2 NFKB1 LSM8 STK26 BCL2L1 BIRC5 MAP3K10 BIRC6 MAP3K11 BIRC7 BIRC8 SLC27A4 BIRC2 BIRC3 BCL2L2 MDM2 NOTCH2 FASLG VPS72 BAG3 BAG4 BAG1 CLEC5A ABL2 PIM2 TNFRSF8 TXNDC5 PIM1 ABL1 BMF PIM3 MOAP1 DNM1L ANGPT4 HSP90AA1 API5 ANGPT1 APAF1 ASNS CFLAR PA2G4 NRG1 OSGIN1 DHCR24 FOXL2 HAX1 SON DNAJC3 DAB2 USP17L6P BCL6 CDK5 TMBIM4 ALB BCL3 NF2 BCL2 CDK1 NF1 ITGA6 TMBIM6 TNFRSF25 MCM2 ALK BCAR1 SHC1 GLO1 MAPKAP1 TRADD NLRC4 APIP HTR2B SAV1 KNG1 PIP5KL1 EMILIN2 NAE1 AMH EMILIN1 BOK IP6K2 ZNF622 CTNNBL1 MCL1 NTRK1 STYK1 GRID2 GZMA MTOR TBX3 DNAJA1 EVI2B IL2RB DNAJA3 MNDA FXN NOP53 TPT1 TRIM35 MTCH1 ITGB1 MTCH2 HDAC3 SRC USP27X FLT3 HDAC1 FLT4 HDAC2 FHL2 ETFA MALT1 MIEN1 OPA1 IGF2BP1 BAK1 FYN C3ORF38 TRIM24 ACTN4 ACTN3 ACTN2 ACTN1 CRADD CIDEB CIDEC PNMA5 CIDEA PNMA3 MAPK8IP3 CCAR1 SFRP4 SFRP2 APC NEURL1 HIP1R ANP32E NSMF ANP32C ALPK2 NAIP ZNF830 TP53 GLS2 LRP2 KHDC3L USP17L20 USP17L22 USP17L21 USP17L24 SFRP1 AQP1 LRP8 CCAR2 ACTB NUAK2 PDCD10 E2F1 APBB1 KDR NTSR1 CCNL2 MAGEA4 EGR1 SIAH1 EGR3 TNFSF18 XBP1 GADD45B GADD45A SIAH2 TOMM70 GADD45G IGF1 TENT5B PTK2 RNF144B ACER2 PIK3R1 WNK3 RNPS1 TDGF1 TNFRSF6B FOXE3 ANP32B BEX1 MAGED1 ANP32A ARL6IP1 DCUN1D3 IFIT2 IKZF3 IFIT3 SOX4 RASSF2 LGALS2 PKHD1 TCL1A LGALS1 KAT5 MBTD1 EPC1 ARL6IP5 EPC2 FFAR4 SOX9 TNFSF10 SOX8 SKP2 CTSB IL10 NLRP2B TNFRSF12A TSC22D1 LILRB1 NME1 RHOB VEGFA NME2 PTMA TFAP4 TOX3 KRT18 CEACAM5 ATM CD28 TAX1BP1 CD27 CALR EEF1E1 FATE1 ARHGEF7 SGK1 PXT1 CSRNP3 CITED1 CITED2 TOP2A OMA1 KIF14 PCSK9 CD3E CX3CL1 IER3IP1 BABAM2 SOCS3 SOCS2 C1QBP HTATIP2 ANKRD1 CD38 CTSH FADD MAP3K20 CTSD NEUROD1 USP17L17 NPM1 USP17L19 USP17L18 PRMT2 DKKL1 HYPK USP17L11 THOC6 USP17L13 ANO6 ITCH USP17L12 HCK USP17L15 RSL1D1 TJP1 BRMS1 STK17A STK17B XIAP AVP GHRL CD40LG CD44 HIP1 ANKRD13C FOXA1 FAF1 CTNNB1 FAIM2 PTMS SH3RF2 SH3RF1 SPTLC1 PNMA2 PNMA1 LCMT1 MAP4K4 TFAP2B CD74 PRLR TGFB3 WNT5A ATAD3A GCG POU4F1 KLHL20 PPIA SHQ1 UBE2Z AXL NUPR1 FAS PPIF DPEP1 PPID RAF1 TFAP2A PRDM9 PAGE4 PRKN RELA NOL3 ZFAND6 MPO CIB1 IFI6 COMP PTPA PAK2 CCND2 PDPN CAPN3 SLIT2 EP400 DMAP1 NIBAN2 OPN3 USP47 SMAD5 PCID2 STIL UTP11 HGF MRGBP POU3F3 SMAD6 PROC GCLC DDAH2 GDNF USP42 CARD14 FCMR RTKN VCP HTRA4 HTRA2 PSEN1 TRIAP1 HTRA1 PSEN2 IGF1R HIGD1A MYDGF TGM2 ARHGAP21 CALHM2 UBB FAM162A UBD PMAIP1 DYNAP HSPA9 STPG1 NAT8B RFPL1 ATP13A2 CBX4 HSPA5 NAA35 RHBDD1 HMGA2 MT3 BFAR RPS3A MMP9 DNM2 HIGD2A IL2 AHI1 BMP4 IL4 RASA1 IL7 BMP2 IL6 JMY IRF5 TMIGD1 AKT1S1 IRF3 PANO1 QRICH1 RBM25 USP36 PSMD10 RTN4 DDX3X GSK3B AVEN DIABLO BCL2A1 TNFAIP8 HMGB1 DDX42 HSPB1 STK3 STK4 CASP8 SCIN CASP9 CASP6 ERBB4 GRK5 ERBB2 ERBB3 GPER1 CASP2 CASP3 ECT2 WNT1 PIDD1 DAPK2 DAPK1 DAPK3 OXSR1 PLAUR YWHAZ SOD1 GOLPH3 GREM1 UFM1 CAT ERCC5 REST RPS6KB1 TCIM ERCC3 NAA15 TAF9 SPRY2 NAA16 VDAC1 LTF PRR5 LTK PRR7 THBS1 DDX20 ACVR1C HSPD1 CBL FLCN GRM4 ARHGDIA RBM5 CLN3 MAPK8 RPS6KA1 RPS6KA3 RPS6KA2 SIX4 BNIP2 PTK2B VHL BNIP3 BNIP1 IFT57	0.4017275	0.020969855832241154	0.21621621621621623	True	False

CHEK1 (Checkpoint kinase 1) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that, in response to DNA damage, coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. It is a key player in the cellular stress response to damaged DNA and is involved in preventing the replication of damaged DNA by activating cell cycle checkpoints.

2. PDCD4 (Programmed cell death protein 4) is a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits neoplastic transformation and translation by binding to eIF4A, playing a role in apoptosis and cell survival.

3. ZFP36L2 (Zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 2) is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. It binds to adenine-uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs and promotes their degradation, thus playing a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level during stress responses.

4. S100A10 (S100 calcium-binding protein A10) is implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. It is also known to play a role in the stress response, particularly in the context of inflammation.

5. ADRB2 (Beta-2 adrenergic receptor) is involved in the response to adrenaline and noradrenaline in various tissues. Activation of this receptor leads to a cascade of events involved in the fight-or-flight response and can also modulate the immune response and apoptosis.

6. AKR1B1 (Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B) is part of the polyol pathway and is involved in the detoxification of aldehydes and ketones, which are products of oxidative stress.

7. OAS1 (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1) is an interferon-induced protein that plays a role in the antiviral response and can induce apoptosis in cells that are infected with a virus.

8. SULF1 (Sulfatase 1) modulates the sulfation state of proteoglycans and is implicated in cellular response to growth factors and in the regulation of cell signaling in response to cellular stress.

9. Other proteins in the list, such as DAB2, EGLN3, MFAP5, MXRA5, PLEKHM1, PTPRE, SLC38A1, SPTSSA, CHGB, CRISP3, CYBA, ENC1, HLA-DMB, HOMER2, NME4, RARRES1, SORD, STX1A, and UGCG, are involved in various cellular processes including signal transduction, metabolism, vesicle trafficking, immune response, and membrane transport. While they may not directly relate to a single cohesive process, their functions can intersect with cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in a range of processes, but a significant number of them play roles in the cellular response to stress and the regulation of apoptosis. These proteins interact in complex ways to maintain cellular integrity and respond to damage, with implications for cell survival, cell cycle control, and programmed cell death. The confidence score reflects the fact that while many proteins in the system contribute to these processes, not all are directly involved, and the system represents a network with diverse functions."	0.85	0	2/6	2.623727537628245e-05	0.0141943659785688	MFAP5;ZFP36L2	Definitive Hemopoiesis (GO:0060216)	Definitive Hemopoiesis 	GO:0060216	MFAP5 LYL1 TEK HIPK1 TGFBR3 ZFP36L2	0.23434742	0.06451612903225806	0.07407407407407407	True	False

Several proteins in this system, such as CD44, VCAN (Versican), and CHI3L1 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1), are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. VCAN is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in tissue remodeling and is often upregulated in various cancers.

2. Proteins like EXT1 (Exostosin-1) and XYLT1 (Xylosyltransferase 1) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, respectively. These activities are crucial for the structure and function of the ECM, which is a key component of the tumor microenvironment.

3. The presence of proteins such as TNFRSF21 (Death receptor 6) and TNFSF10 (TRAIL) indicates involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways. These proteins can modulate cell death and survival, which are critical processes in cancer progression and response to therapy.

4. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family of proteins that are involved in regulating cell fate and patterning during development. In the context of cancer, WNT5A has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.

5. The system includes immune-related proteins such as IGHM, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20, and IGL, which are components of immunoglobulins. These suggest a role in immune surveillance or response within the tumor microenvironment.

6. Proteins like TGFBR2 (Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II) and S100A6 are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGFBR2 is a key mediator of TGF-beta signaling, which has complex roles in tumor progression, including tumor suppression in early stages and promotion of invasion and metastasis in later stages.

The proteins listed are involved in various aspects of cellular biology, including but not limited to transcription regulation, signal transduction, metabolism, protein folding and degradation, cell cycle control, and stress responses. Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying biological process, it is not possible to assign a specific name that accurately represents the collective activities of these proteins.

For instance, proteins such as MYB, NCOA2, and TFAP2C are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation, but they regulate different sets of genes and are involved in distinct biological processes. Similarly, proteins like ERBB2 and ERBB3 are receptor tyrosine kinases that play roles in cell signaling and growth, yet they do not define the overall function of the system.

Metabolic enzymes such as AKR1B10 and GSTA4 are involved in detoxification and redox balance, while proteins like HSPA1A and DNAJB1 are molecular chaperones that assist in protein folding and stress responses. Cell cycle regulators such as CCNE2 and CDC25A are crucial for cell division, but again, they do not represent a common process for the entire system.

The diversity of these proteins suggests that they are involved in multiple, unrelated cellular pathways and processes. Therefore, the most appropriate designation for this system is ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the lack of a singular, overarching biological process that characterizes their collective function.

Several proteins in this system are directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis. DHCR7, FDFT1, and MSMO1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. DHCR7 catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, FDFT1 is involved in the first committed step of sterol synthesis, and MSMO1 is responsible for the conversion of methylsterol intermediates to cholesterol.

2. INSIG1 and LDLR are critical in cholesterol regulation. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism.

3. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fats are components of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides, and they play a role in the fluidity and function of biological membranes, which can indirectly affect cholesterol metabolism.

4. The presence of other proteins such as PXDN and CLDN10, which are involved in extracellular matrix formation and tight junctions respectively, suggests additional roles in tissue organization and integrity, which may be related to the broader context of cholesterol metabolism and its impact on cellular structures.

Proteins like TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2) indicate a connection to signaling pathways that can influence cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which may intersect with cholesterol metabolism in complex ways, such as in the regulation of cell growth and the synthesis of membrane components.

To summarize, the prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is centered around cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation. The system includes enzymes directly involved in the production of cholesterol, proteins that regulate its synthesis and uptake, and factors that may influence or be influenced by cholesterol metabolism in the context of cell signaling and structural integrity.

Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1), FDFT1 (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1), FDPS (farnesyl diphosphate synthase), SQLE (squalene epoxidase), DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase), MSMO1 (methylsterol monooxygenase 1), SC5D (sterol-C5-desaturase), and CYP51A1 (cytochrome P450, family 51), are directly involved in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. INSIG1 is an ER membrane protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that regulate the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. LDLR is responsible for the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, thus reducing plasma cholesterol levels.

3. IDI1 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1) is involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is a precursor to cholesterol synthesis.

4. CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) and DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4) may indirectly influence cholesterol biosynthesis through their roles in gene expression and stress response, respectively.

5. Other proteins such as GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase pi 1), SERPINE2 (serpin family E member 2), and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) are involved in various cellular processes including detoxification, blood coagulation, and cell-matrix interactions, which may not directly relate to cholesterol biosynthesis but could influence the overall cellular environment in which cholesterol metabolism occurs.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the synthesis, regulation, and homeostasis of cholesterol, a fundamental component of cell membranes and precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids. The system reflects a coordinated network of enzymes and regulatory proteins that ensure the balance of cholesterol levels within cells and throughout the body."	0.92	0	9/25	2.3634335852693133e-18	1.2337123315105817e-15	HMGCS1;INSIG1;CYP51A1;SC5D;MSMO1;HMGCR;DHCR7;FDFT1;CES1	Cholesterol Biosynthetic Process (GO:0006695)	Cholesterol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0006695	G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 LSS DHCR24 ACLY GLB1 PLPP6 MVD DHCR7 CES1 MVK INSIG2 INSIG1 HMGCR HSD17B7 MSMO1 TM7SF2 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 SC5D LBR FDFT1	0.78023106	0.140625	0.1875	True	True

HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. It is subject to complex regulation by various mechanisms, including feedback inhibition by cholesterol derivatives.

2. HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1) is another key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, catalyzing the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is then reduced by HMGCR.

3. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) is a regulatory protein that binds to HMGCR and facilitates its degradation, thus playing a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis. It acts as a mediator of sterol-regulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HMGCR.

4. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, which is a primary mechanism for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream and regulating intracellular cholesterol levels.

5. PCSK1 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1) is an enzyme that processes precursor proteins into their active forms. It is involved in the maturation of proteins that participate in cholesterol metabolism, such as proproteins that become receptors or enzymes in lipid metabolic pathways.

The proteins listed above are directly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, indicating a system primarily engaged in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation. The interplay between these proteins ensures that cholesterol levels within cells and in the bloodstream are tightly controlled, which is critical for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and producing steroid hormones and bile acids.

Other proteins in the system, such as 1060P11.3, AEBP1, AMIGO2, CNPY3, FABP7, PLK2, RCAN1, SCGB1D2, SCGB2A2, ST6GAL1, TFAP2A, VTCN1, APLP2, BAG3, CDC42EP3, FERMT1, HSPB8, ID1, KCNJ15, STX1A, UBE2S, VCAN, WFDC2, and ZNF652, may have roles in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune response, and protein folding. However, their direct involvement in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation is not as clear from the information provided. Therefore, while the primary process is confidently identified, the presence of these additional proteins suggests a broader range of cellular activities, which slightly lowers the confidence score."	0.85	0	3/24	5.434745095891566e-06	0.0010573246118052	HMGCS1;INSIG1;HMGCR	Secondary Alcohol Biosynthetic Process (GO:1902653)	Secondary Alcohol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:1902653	CES1 MVK G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 INSIG2 INSIG1 HMGCR LSS DHCR24 HSD17B7 MSMO1 TM7SF2 ACLY GLB1 PLPP6 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 LBR MVD DHCR7 FDFT1	0.3842399	0.06	0.10344827586206896	True	False

The proteins ADM, CXCL8, and WNT5A are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. ADM (adrenomedullin) has vasodilatory properties and can promote angiogenesis, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory chemokine that can recruit immune cells to the tumor site, potentially contributing to inflammation and tumor progression. WNT5A is part of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation.

2. Proteins such as BNIP3L, DDIT4, and EGLN3 are associated with cellular responses to hypoxia, a common feature of the tumor microenvironment. BNIP3L (also known as NIX) is involved in hypoxia-induced apoptosis and autophagy. DDIT4 (REDD1) is a regulator of the mTOR pathway in response to hypoxia. EGLN3 (PHD3) is a prolyl hydroxylase that regulates the stability of HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor), a key transcription factor in hypoxic response.

3. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, and proteins such as HK2, PDK1, PFKFB3, PGK1, and ALDOA are key players in this process. HK2 (hexokinase 2) catalyzes the first step of glycolysis and is often upregulated in cancer cells. PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, reducing the flow of pyruvate into the TCA cycle and promoting glycolysis. PFKFB3 regulates the production of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent activator of glycolysis. PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) and ALDOA (aldolase A) are glycolytic enzymes that facilitate the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, providing energy and biosynthetic precursors for rapidly proliferating cancer cells.

4. The proteins AURKA, CCNB1, CDC20, CDC25B, PLK1, and TOP2A are involved in cell cycle regulation and mitosis, processes that are often dysregulated in cancer. AURKA (aurora kinase A) and PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1) are critical for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and CDC25B (cell division cycle 25B) are important for the G2/M transition. TOP2A (topoisomerase II alpha) is essential for DNA replication and chromosome separation.

5. The immune response is also represented by proteins such as HLA-B, STAT1, and IFIT1. HLA-B is a major histocompatibility complex class I molecule involved in the presentation of peptide antigens to T cells. STAT1 is a transcription factor that mediates the response to interferons, which have anti-tumor effects. IFIT1 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) is induced by interferons and can have antiviral and anti-proliferative roles.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of cancer progression, including modulation of the tumor microenvironment, metabolic reprogramming, cell cycle regulation, and immune response. The interplay between these proteins can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. The majority of the proteins listed contribute to these processes, indicating a high level of functional integration within the system."	0.88	0	4/8	1.6407960347801162e-08	1.5242995163107276e-05	CDC20;UBE2C;UBE2S;PLK1	Positive Regulation Of Ubiquitin Protein Ligase Activity (GO:1904668)	Positive Regulation Of Ubiquitin Protein Ligase Activity 	GO:1904668	FZR1 PLK1 UBE2C UBE2S PTEN CDC14B SKP1 CDC20	0.22178145	0.047619047619047616	0.05	True	False

Without clear evidence of its role, it is difficult to relate it to a specific biological process within this system.

2. AHNAK2 is a large scaffold protein implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, membrane organization, and cellular movement. It has been associated with the regulation of calcium signaling and may play a role in cancer progression.

3. ALDH2 is an enzyme involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, including the metabolism of ethanol. It is a key enzyme in the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase family that contributes to the protection against oxidative stress.

4. IGKV4-1 represents an immunoglobulin kappa variable gene, which is part of the adaptive immune response. Immunoglobulins are crucial for antigen recognition and are involved in various immune processes.

5. SLC38A1 is a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter that plays a role in the cellular uptake of amino acids, particularly in the brain and other tissues.

6. CCND1 encodes cyclin D1, a regulatory protein involved in cell cycle progression. It is essential for the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle and is often implicated in cancer.

7. MYB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in hematopoiesis and is involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation of blood cells.

8. SFRP4 is a member of the secreted frizzled-related protein family, which modulates Wnt signaling. It acts as a soluble modulator of Wnt signaling and is involved in processes such as bone formation and tumor progression.

9. SORD encodes sorbitol dehydrogenase, which is involved in the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism. It catalyzes the conversion of sorbitol to fructose and is implicated in diabetic complications.

To summarize, the proteins listed do not appear to converge on a single, prominent biological process. They are involved in a diverse array of functions, including signal transduction, metabolism, immune response, cell cycle regulation, transcriptional control, and modulation of signaling pathways. The lack of a unifying theme or pathway among these proteins suggests that they do not form a coherent system dedicated to a specific biological process. Therefore, the most appropriate designation for this group of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the absence of a predominant biological process."	0.0	0	4/1127	0.0010053695452714	0.0310185739396817	SFRP4;MYB;AHNAK2;SORD	Regulation Of Gene Expression (GO:0010468)	Regulation Of Gene Expression 	GO:0010468	ZNF284 ZNF282 ZNF281 DICER1

Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1), FDPS (farnesyl diphosphate synthase), SQLE (squalene epoxidase), LSS (lanosterol synthase), DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase), and CYP51A1 (lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase), are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. These enzymes are involved in the sequential conversion of acetyl-CoA to cholesterol.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) is a regulatory protein that controls the cholesterol synthesis pathway by mediating the retention of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing their activation. When cholesterol levels are low, SREBPs are transported to the Golgi apparatus to be processed and then enter the nucleus to activate genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake, including HMGCR and LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor).

3. LDLR is a cell surface receptor that mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, which is a primary mechanism for the removal of cholesterol from the bloodstream and its delivery to peripheral tissues.

4. IDI1 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1), FDPS, and MSMO1 (methylsterol monooxygenase 1) are also involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and non-sterol isoprenoids, which are critical for various cellular functions, including membrane integrity and protein prenylation.

5. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is involved in fatty acid metabolism, specifically the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. This process is important for the fluidity of cell membranes and is also linked to the regulation of lipid metabolism, including cholesterol.

6. Proteins such as CDKN1B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B) and SFN (14-3-3 sigma) are involved in cell cycle regulation and may indirectly influence cholesterol biosynthesis by affecting cell proliferation and the overall metabolic demands of cells.

7. The presence of proteins like SERPINA1 (alpha-1-antitrypsin) and CCL20 (chemokine ligand 20) suggests additional roles in inflammation and immune response, which can be modulated by lipid mediators derived from cholesterol metabolism.

8. Other proteins in the system, such as CALM3 (calmodulin 3), PLCB1 (phospholipase C beta 1), and HSPA2 (heat shock protein family A member 2), are involved in signal transduction and stress responses, which may interact with cholesterol metabolism pathways or be affected by membrane composition changes due to cholesterol levels.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, a fundamental component of cell membranes and precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids. The system also includes proteins that may influence cholesterol metabolism indirectly through cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. The interplay between these proteins ensures the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis, which is critical for cellular function and overall organismal health."	0.92	0	8/28	6.652013049242466e-17	3.292746459375022e-14	SQLE;HMGCS1;INSIG1;CYP51A1;MSMO1;HMGCR;DHCR7;LSS	Sterol Biosynthetic Process (GO:0016126)	Sterol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0016126	G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 LSS DHCR24 ACLY SQLE GLB1 PLPP6 MVD DHCR7 CES1 MVK FAXDC2 INSIG2 INSIG1 PRKAG2 HMGCR HSD17B7 MSMO1 CH25H TM7SF2 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 LBR FDFT1	0.7302654	0.1509433962264151	0.24242424242424243	True	True

1. Several proteins such as HMGCS1 (involved in cholesterol biosynthesis), IDH1 (a key enzyme in the TCA cycle), and INSIG1 (regulator of cholesterol synthesis) are related to metabolic processes, but they are not part of a cohesive metabolic pathway.

2. Proteins like IFNAR1 (interferon receptor) and VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor) are involved in signaling pathways, but these pathways are distinct and serve different biological contexts, such as immune response and angiogenesis, respectively.

3. TGFBR3 (transforming growth factor-beta receptor III) and DKK1 (Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor) are associated with growth factor signaling and developmental processes, yet they operate within different signaling networks.

Several proteins in this system, such as FADS1, FASN, HMGCS1, INSIG1, LDLR, LSS, MSMO1, SCD, and SQLE, are directly involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis. FADS1 is involved in the desaturation of fatty acids, a critical step in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. FASN is a key enzyme in de novo lipogenesis, catalyzing the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. HMGCS1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis.

2. INSIG1 is a regulatory protein that mediates feedback control of cholesterol synthesis by binding to sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). LDLR is a receptor that mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. LSS, MSMO1, and SQLE are all enzymes involved in the multi-step process of cholesterol synthesis, with SQLE being a rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway.

3. SCD is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are important components of membrane phospholipids and also serve as lipid signaling molecules.

4. Other proteins in the system, such as CYP1B1 and SERPING1, have roles that are tangentially related to lipid metabolism. CYP1B1 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of various lipophilic compounds, and SERPING1 is a serine protease inhibitor that can influence inflammation and vascular function, processes that are affected by lipid metabolism.

5. The remaining proteins, including 1060P11.3, HSPA6, PEG3, PTBP3, RHOB, RPL37A, RPL38, ACTG2, BCHE, CASP1, CD40, CDKN2A, MAGEA3, RGS1, RGS2, SORL1, WLS, and NPY1R, are involved in a diverse array of biological processes. These range from protein synthesis (RPL37A, RPL38), stress response (HSPA6), apoptosis (CASP1), cell cycle regulation (CDKN2A), to signal transduction (RGS1, RGS2) and neurotransmission (NPY1R). While these proteins have important roles in cellular function, they do not directly contribute to the central process of lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis, with a significant number of proteins directly participating in these pathways. However, the presence of proteins with diverse and unrelated functions suggests that this system also engages in other cellular processes, which is reflected in the confidence score."	0.85	0	5/28	5.12905296691877e-10	2.231138040609666e-07	SQLE;HMGCS1;INSIG1;MSMO1;LSS	Sterol Biosynthetic Process (GO:0016126)	Sterol Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0016126	G6PD CYP51A1 HMGCS1 LSS DHCR24 ACLY SQLE GLB1 PLPP6 MVD DHCR7 CES1 MVK FAXDC2 INSIG2 INSIG1 PRKAG2 HMGCR HSD17B7 MSMO1 CH25H TM7SF2 NSDHL NPC1L1 PMVK ARV1 LBR FDFT1	0.7268362	0.09433962264150944	0.16666666666666666	True	False

These proteins are involved in various cellular activities, including but not limited to, metabolism, signal transduction, stress response, immune response, and cellular structure maintenance. Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying process, it is appropriate to classify this as a ""System of unrelated proteins.""

1. The proteins listed include transcription factors (e.g., FOXO1, FOSL1, FOSL2, SOX4), enzymes (e.g., ASNS, CBR3, ME1), and transporters (e.g., SLC2A1, SLC2A3), among others. Each of these proteins plays roles in distinct cellular pathways and processes.

2. Some proteins are involved in the stress response and molecular chaperoning (e.g., DNAJB1, HSPA1A), while others are implicated in the immune response (e.g., CXCL8, IL1R2, HLA-DQA1).

3. There are proteins that participate in cell signaling and regulation (e.g., KRAS, SRC), but they are not focused on a single signaling pathway or regulatory process.

4. Proteins like ANXA4 and ANXA6 are involved in membrane-related processes, whereas others like CPE and PTPRN2 have roles in vesicular trafficking and secretion.

5. Several proteins have roles in cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix (e.g., CD44, COL11A1), but they do not collectively represent a process like tissue development or wound healing.

6. Metabolic enzymes (e.g., GCLC, GCLM) and transporters (e.g., SLC2A1, SLC2A3) are present, but they are involved in different metabolic pathways and do not suggest a unified metabolic process.

7. There are also proteins with roles in the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis (e.g., DDIT3, DDIT4), but again, they are not part of a coherent process such as transcriptional regulation or translation.

In conclusion, the proteins in this system do not exhibit a clear pattern of interaction or functional coherence that would suggest a single, prominent biological process.

The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a cellular defense mechanism activated by various stress conditions, including amino acid deprivation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Proteins such as ATF3, ATF4, DDIT3 (also known as CHOP), and GADD45A are key transcription factors and downstream effectors in the ISR. They regulate gene expression to restore cellular homeostasis or induce apoptosis if the stress is too severe.

2. ER-associated proteins like DNAJC10 (ERdj5), DNAJC3 (P58IPK), EDEM1, HERPUD1, HSPA5 (BiP/GRP78), and SERP1 are involved in protein folding and the unfolded protein response (UPR), a subset of the ISR. These proteins help to alleviate ER stress by enhancing the degradation of misfolded proteins and improving the protein folding capacity of the ER.

3. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as CARS, GARS, IARS, and WARS are essential for protein synthesis, linking amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs. Under stress conditions, they can have non-canonical functions, including signaling roles in the ISR.

4. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of proteins that provides structural support to cells and tissues. COL1A1 and COL4A5 are collagen proteins that contribute to the ECM's integrity. LAMB1 is a laminin, crucial for basement membrane assembly. THBS2 and CHI3L1 are involved in ECM remodeling and cell-matrix interactions.

5. Proteins like HMGCR and HMGCS1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis, which is tightly regulated by cellular stress and energy status. LDLR is involved in cholesterol uptake, and SCD is a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis, indicating a link between stress response and lipid metabolism.

6. Several proteins in the system, such as ASS1, ASNS, PSAT1, and GFPT1, are involved in amino acid metabolism and the cellular response to amino acid availability, which is closely related to the ISR.

7. MYC is a well-known oncogene and transcription factor that regulates various cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. Its activity can be influenced by stress responses and nutrient availability.

8. The presence of proteins like CD163, CFH, and VSIG4, which are involved in immune responses and inflammation, suggests a connection between stress responses and immune modulation.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), EPAS1 (Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1), and TSC22D3 (TSC22 domain family protein 3), are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. DDIT4 is a modulator of the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. EPAS1, also known as HIF-2α, is a transcription factor that responds to hypoxia and regulates genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. TSC22D3 is a glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein that can regulate inflammatory responses and cellular growth.

2. The presence of metabolic enzymes such as ASNS (asparagine synthetase), GLS (glutaminase), PCK2 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2), and PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) indicates a role in metabolic regulation. ASNS is involved in the biosynthesis of asparagine and adaptation to cellular stress, while GLS catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, a key step in energy and nitrogen metabolism. PCK2 is an enzyme in gluconeogenesis, converting oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and PGK1 is a glycolytic enzyme, highlighting the system's involvement in balancing energy production and consumption.

3. Chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL11, along with their regulatory proteins, suggest a role in immune response and inflammation. These chemokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, which is critical during stress and injury.

4. Proteins like CAV1 (caveolin 1) and ENPP2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2) are involved in signal transduction and lipid metabolism, respectively. CAV1 is a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes, influencing various signaling pathways, while ENPP2 is involved in the generation of lysophosphatidic acid, a lipid signaling molecule.

5. Growth factors and their regulators, such as AREG (amphiregulin), EREG (epiregulin), BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4), and FAM129A (family with sequence similarity 129 member A), are indicative of roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development.

6. The presence of XIST (X inactive specific transcript) suggests a connection to epigenetic regulation, as XIST is involved in X-chromosome inactivation, a process of dosage compensation in females.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, immune response, signal transduction, and growth factor activity. The system appears to be geared towards maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes, with a significant number of proteins contributing to these processes. The name ""Cellular Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation"" reflects the dual focus on managing cellular stress and regulating metabolic pathways, which is supported by a majority of the genes in the system."	0.85	0	6/100	8.125995834190389e-08	5.192511338047658e-05	CXCL11;CXCL9;CXCL8;SLPI;CXCL1;PI3	Antimicrobial Humoral Response (GO:0019730)	Antimicrobial Humoral Response 	GO:0019730	H2BC8 DEFA5 FAM3A DEFA6 RARRES2 DEFA3 DEFA4 DEFA1 H2BC12L CXCL10 CXCL11 CXCL13 SLPI FAU S100A7 PF4 S100A9 IGKV3-20 WFDC13 WFDC12 PRSS2 WFDC11 CXCL14 DEFB1 KRT6A ROMO1 PRSS3 S100A12 HMGN2 MUC7 SLC11A1 TSLP PPBP HLA-A HLA-E WFDC10B PRTN3 WFDC10A REG1A WFDC9 RPL30 REG1B WFDC2 PLA2G6 WFDC5 WFDC3 BPIFA1 RPS19 PI3 IL36RN RPL39 NRG1 AZU1 LYZ H2BC11 H2BC12 DEFB4A CXCL8 REG3A CXCL9 REG3G LEAP2 CXCL2 CXCL1 CXCL3 CXCL6 JCHAIN CXCL5 CTSG SPRR2A IGHA2 CAMP IGHA1 PF4V1 SPAG11B DEFB118 RNASE7 CST9LP1 RNASE6 F2 F3 RNASE3 SEMG1 SEMG2 GALP LTF GAPDH IGHM CST9L CCL13 COLEC11 PGLYRP4 PGLYRP3 PLA2G1B DEFB127 DEFB126 CST9 GNLY H2BC21 PGLYRP1	0.31404096	0.043478260869565216	0.13636363636363635	True	False

ACTL6A, CHD3, and ING4 are components of chromatin remodeling complexes that alter the structure of chromatin to regulate access to DNA. ACTL6A is part of the SWI/SNF complex, which is involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes. CHD3 is a member of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex, which has roles in chromatin compaction and gene silencing. ING4 associates with histone acetyltransferase complexes and can modulate chromatin structure and transcription.

2. BCL6, CREBBP, EP300, NR3C1, RELA, RUNX1, TP53, and YY1 are transcription factors or co-regulators that directly influence gene expression. BCL6 is a sequence-specific repressor of transcription, while CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that activate transcription by remodeling chromatin. NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response. RELA is a subunit of NF-kB, a transcription factor involved in inflammatory and immune responses. RUNX1 is critical for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. TP53 (p53) is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in apoptosis, growth arrest, and DNA repair. YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor that can act as an activator, repressor, or initiator-binding protein.

3. H2AFZ and HIST1H4A are histone variants; H2AFZ is a replacement for the canonical histone H2A and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. HIST1H4A is a core component of the nucleosome, and its post-translational modifications are critical for transcriptional regulation.

4. HNRNPD (also known as AUF1) is an RNA-binding protein that influences mRNA stability and turnover, thereby indirectly affecting gene expression.

5. KAT6A and TERT are involved in modifying chromatin structure and telomere maintenance, respectively. KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase that can regulate transcription through chromatin remodeling. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, can also regulate gene expression independently of its role in telomere elongation.

6. MTA3, PML, TBL1XR1, and TNF are involved in various aspects of chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation. MTA3 is a component of the NuRD complex, like CHD3, and is involved in gene silencing. PML is involved in the formation of nuclear bodies and can regulate transcription. TBL1XR1 is part of the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex, which mediates transcriptional repression. TNF is primarily known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine but can also influence gene expression through activation of NF-kB.

Other proteins in the list, such as SLC39A6 and SLC39A10, are members of the solute carrier family and are involved in metal ion transport. Their functions are critical for cellular metal homeostasis but are not directly related to the functions of zinc finger proteins.

Proteins like EPM2AIP1, TBC1D19, and TPGS1 have roles in various cellular processes including mRNA processing, intracellular trafficking, and protein transport, respectively. These functions, while essential to cellular operation, do not suggest a common biological process shared with the other proteins in the list.

TTC23, TTLL1, and MYSM1 are involved in processes such as tubulin modification, histone demethylation, and gene expression regulation. Again, these are important cellular functions but do not align under a single biological process with the other proteins mentioned.

NICN1, PGBD1, and LRRC49, along with the zinc finger proteins ZKSCAN1, ZKSCAN8, ZSCAN1, and ZSCAN21, are involved in various aspects of nucleic acid binding and regulation, but they do not appear to converge on a specific, shared biological pathway based on the information provided.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular functions, ranging from metabolism to signal transduction, and from gene regulation to structural support. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions:

1. Proteins such as ANKRD10, EML5, and the CECR2 are involved in structural and regulatory roles within the cell, but they do not share a common pathway or process.

2. APOA2 is associated with lipid metabolism and transport, while CYP4F22 is involved in fatty acid metabolism, yet these functions do not suggest a unified biological process within this system.

3. ARMCX5, BBS12, and C8orf37 are part of different complexes and pathways, including those related to ciliary function and transport, but again, they do not indicate a cohesive biological process.

4. Proteins like FFAR4 (a G-protein coupled receptor) and GNRHR (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor) are involved in signaling pathways, but they are not part of the same signaling cascade or physiological response.

5. Enzymes such as OPLAH and GPCPD1 have roles in metabolic processes, but these are not part of a singular metabolic pathway that defines the system.

6. The presence of various proteins with unclear or poorly characterized functions (e.g., C1orf56, C4orf36, C14orf28, C15orf62, FAM102A, FAM126B, FAM174B, FAM218A, FAM222B) further complicates the identification of a common biological process.

7. The diversity of chromosome locations (e.g., C1orf56 from chromosome 1, C4orf36 from chromosome 4) and the varied naming convention (e.g., ANKRD10, BBS12, GPR88) do not suggest a shared biological process or pathway.

In conclusion, the proteins listed do not exhibit a clear functional integration or a shared role in a specific biological process. The system appears to be a collection of unrelated proteins, each with its own distinct function within the cell. Therefore, the most appropriate name for the biological process performed by this system is ""System of unrelated proteins,"" and the confidence score is 0.00, indicating the lowest confidence in a unified biological process."	0.0	0	2/28	0.0013563647961941	0.1302537829201136	APOA2;GPCPD1	Phospholipid Catabolic Process (GO:0009395)	Phospholipid Catabolic Process 	GO:0009395	PLA2G4E PLA2G4F PLA2G4C PLA2G4D PLA2G4A APOA2 PLA2G4B GPCPD1 PLPP6 GDPD1 PLBD1 ANGPTL3 PLBD2 PNPLA6 SMPDL3A PNLIPRP2 GDE1 GDPD3 PLD2 PLD1 LIPG SMPD4 SMPD3 PRDX6 SMPD2 SMPD1 ENPP2 ENPP6	0.22657171	0.03076923076923077	0.05128205128205128	False	False

MAGEL2 is a member of the MAGE family and is involved in intracellular trafficking and neurodevelopment. It has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy and endosomal sorting, particularly in neurons. Mutations in MAGEL2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting its critical role in these processes.

2. SNX5, SNX6, and SNX7 are part of the sorting nexin family. These proteins are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking. They play roles in the retromer complex, which is essential for the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. SNX5 and SNX6 have been shown to form a subcomplex that is implicated in the sorting of transmembrane proteins.

3. WASHC3 is a component of the WASH complex, which is involved in the actin-dependent process of endosomal sorting. It plays a role in the fission of tubules that serve as transport intermediates. The WASH complex is critical for the sorting of endosomal cargo and the recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane.

4. WDFY1 is a FYVE domain-containing protein that has been implicated in endosomal trafficking. It is involved in the early stages of autophagosome formation and may act as an adaptor protein that recruits other proteins to the endosome.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the processes of endosomal sorting and trafficking. They contribute to the proper distribution and recycling of cellular components, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental cues. The involvement of these proteins in the retromer complex and the WASH complex highlights their integrated roles in the endosomal system. The presence of MAGEL2 also suggests a specific importance in neuronal cells, potentially linking endosomal trafficking to neurodevelopmental processes."	0.91	0	5/180	3.3263813190465253e-10	2.394994549713498e-08	MAGEL2;SNX7;SNX5;SNX6;WASHC3	Endosomal Transport (GO:0016197)	Endosomal Transport 	GO:0016197	ANKRD27 PLEKHA3 ANKFY1 AP5B1 BLTP1 DCLK1 ZFYVE16 ACAP2 TMCC1 RAB35 UBE2O TBC1D23 SQSTM1 VPS29 TMEM87A TMEM87B STX16 ZFYVE9 AP5Z1 WASHC2C ASB15 SNX33 STX10 GGA1 STX12 WASHC2A LAPTM4B MICALL1 MICALL2 SNX27 VTI1B STX6 VTI1A STX5 YKT6 DENND5A RAB29 RAB11FIP3 RILP VPS16 RAB11FIP4 PLEKHJ1 REPS1 REPS2 TBC1D17 DENND2A BET1L MYO5B RASSF9 NSG1 SNF8 NSG2 WASH3P EHD1 EHD2 PICALM EHD3 EHD4 HGS PREPL CHMP2B CHMP3 CHMP2A CCDC22 VAMP3 VAMP4 WASHC5 ITSN1 ITSN2 CLEC16A DPY30 VPS26B ARHGAP1 ARL1 GCC2 VPS26C WASH2P MAGEL2 VPS26A CORO1C RHOBTB3 RAB43 BLOC1S1 BLOC1S2 CHMP1B CHMP1A TOM1 AP5S1 CCDC93 WASHC1 WASHC3 WASHC4 RAB6D EIPR1 CMTM6 EPS15L1 BAIAP3 PHETA1 RBSN PHETA2 ARL4C HEATR5B CALY PIKFYVE HEATR5A RAB7A VPS35L DENND1C ANXA8L1 TINAGL1 VPS4A DENND1B DENND1A VPS4B CLTC AGAP2 PTPN23 WASH4P AP5M1 SNX4 SNX5 SNX2 VPS50 SNX3 DENND10 VPS52 SNX1 VPS51 CLTCL1 VPS54 VPS53 ENTR1 EPS15 EVI5 RAB6B RAB6C SNX9 SNX6 RAB6A SNX7 RIC1 SPAG9 GBF1 SORT1 LMTK2 RAB11B RAB10 RGP1 RNF126 SNX17 TBC1D5 SNX18 RAB13 ALS2 RAB14 LAMTOR1 RAB9A RAB9B RAB17 ARF6 GOSR1 SLC66A2 WIPF3 ALMS1 WASH6P DCTN1 SNX12 RCSD1 CLN5 ALS2CL ARFRP1 ANXA8 ERC1 TRIM27 VPS35 ANKRD50 TBC1D10A TBC1D10B TBC1D10C VPS39	0.8152019	0.027624309392265192	0.8333333333333334	True	False

MGMT, also known as O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, is involved in the direct repair of alkylated DNA. It removes mutagenic and cytotoxic adducts from the O-6 position of guanine, thereby preventing erroneous base pairing and mutations.

2. MUTYH is a base excision repair enzyme that recognizes and excises oxidatively damaged DNA bases like 8-oxoguanine, which can mispair with adenine, leading to mutations during replication if left unrepaired.

3. TDP1, or tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, functions in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks containing a 3'-end blocking lesion and is particularly important for the resolution of topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes.

4. SLX4IP interacts with SLX4, a structure-specific endonuclease subunit, which is involved in the repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks and in the maintenance of telomeres in association with the telomere maintenance complex.

5. HUS1B is a component of the 9-1-1 cell cycle checkpoint response complex that plays a critical role in DNA damage response and repair as well as maintaining genomic stability.

6. HPRT1, or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1, while primarily known for its role in the purine salvage pathway, also has a role in maintaining genomic integrity by participating in DNA repair.

7. PARN, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease, is involved in the control of mRNA stability and has been implicated in the regulation of DNA repair mRNA transcripts, influencing the DNA damage response.

8. RRAD, Ras-related associated with diabetes, is a small GTPase that may be involved in the cellular stress response, although its role in DNA repair is not well characterized.

9. SAPCD1 (suppressor APC domain containing 1), DOCK9 (dedicator of cytokinesis 9), C10orf88 (chromosome 10 open reading frame 88), THUMPD1 (THUMP domain containing 1), WDCP (WD repeat and coiled-coil containing), and ZBTB14 (zinc finger and BTB domain containing 14) are proteins with less clearly defined roles in DNA repair or genomic stability, but they may contribute to these processes through indirect mechanisms or as part of larger protein complexes.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly or indirectly involved in the recognition, signaling, and repair of DNA damage, as well as the maintenance of genomic stability. The interplay between these proteins ensures the integrity of the genome is preserved, preventing mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer. The presence of several key DNA repair enzymes and associated factors suggests a coordinated network focused on safeguarding the cell's genetic information."	0.85	0	4/288	3.7616493946738506e-05	0.0015472004129784	MGMT;TDP1;HUS1B;MUTYH	DNA Metabolic Process (GO:0006259)	DNA Metabolic Process 	GO:0006259	ENDOG DUT TREX2 CNBP HUS1 RECQL REV1 WDHD1 SMARCA5 EID3 NEIL3 APLF ADPRS ASF1A DNA2 NEIL1 RAN PARG SMARCAL1 SMARCB1 TRRAP SP100 PNKP BACH1 TFPT CHEK1 NTHL1 ZNF827 PCLAF LONP1 ZRANB3 XRCC5 XRCC6 ACTL6A GADD45A TOP3A XRCC3 INTS3 TOP3B INO80 XRCC2 CSNK1E TERF1 TERF2 SETMAR SUPV3L1 UCHL5 FAM111B FAM111A PSME4 GRWD1 TDP1 RAD17 RAD18 MMS19 SET FOXE1 MUS81 XPA ZBTB1 PRKDC XPC ALKBH3 ALKBH1 TREX1 BARD1 ZNF365 CTC1 UPF1 RMI1 MCRS1 PTGES3 RMI2 DNTT RAD51C RAD51B RAD51D DMC1 ATM ATR CENPS DOT1L EXD2 TOP2B BTG2 TOP2A BRCA1 MRPL36 RAD51AP1 HLTF TERT MBD4 NPM1 DFFB PARP4 MGMT PARP2 PARP3 PARP1 CHD1L RPA2 GTF2H1 RPA3 NOC3L GTF2H3 RPA1 GTF2H4 KIN DDB2 DDB1 RPA4 APEX1 PWWP3A TIMELESS UBE2V2 DNASE1L3 DNASE1L1 DNASE1L2 FEN1 FBH1 OGG1 PRIM2 PRIM1 STON1 NUDT1 PTMS UNG RECQL5 RECQL4 WRN NFRKB NUDT15 UVRAG GEN1 LIG1 USP3 DONSON INIP LIG4 UBE2A LIG3 MSH2 UBE2B HINFP MSH3 POLE2 UBE2T POLE3 MSH6 SLX1A MRE11 UBE2N DCLRE1C DCLRE1B CHRNA4 PARK7 TYMS MACROH2A1 RUVBL1 NT5E YY1 SLX4 TBRG1 PURA RUVBL2 NBN EP400 NT5M KMT5C SMARCAD1 ZNF668 KMT5B RBBP8 RPS3 KPNA2 FANCL NABP1 USP45 FANCA LTO1 FANCC FANCG ISG20 FSCN1 NABP2 RNASEH2A MNAT1 INO80B RAD9A RAD9B INO80D INO80C BLM INO80E VCP FMR1 PDS5B PDS5A HELB MEN1 RAG1 RFC4 RFC5 ACTR8 RFC2 RFC3 ACTR5 AXIN2 LRWD1 NAP1L1 TICRR REXO4 SMC1A POLA1 POLA2 NSMCE4A DNASE1 RRM2B CDK2 MCM4 RBMS1 CDK1 MCM5 DCTPP1 MCM6 DNASE2 MCM7 TOP1 MCM2 TERF2IP MCM3 HMGB3 HUS1B MCM10 HMGB1 HMGB2 TENT4A RTEL1 ORC6 ORC5 RAD21 ORC2 ORC1 ORC4 ORC3 TOP1MT TOPBP1 ATRIP MUTYH TCF7L2 RRM1 ATRX POLQ NSMCE3 GLRX2 RAD50 TSN ERCC1 CDC34 RAD51 RAD52 ERCC4 THAP9 ERCC5 ERCC3 NOP53 MCM8 MCM9 SAMHD1 ENDOV POLB CBS CDC45 POLE HPF1 EXO1 POLD1 SUMO1 POLD2 POLD3 TDG FBXO6 POLL TRIM28 POLG INSL6 POLI POLH	0.62410593	0.013422818791946308	0.2857142857142857	True	False

CEP41 is a centrosomal protein that plays a role in microtubule organization. It is implicated in ciliogenesis and may be involved in the Joubert syndrome, a disorder affecting the development of the cerebellum and brainstem.

2. DPP4, also known as CD26, is a serine exopeptidase that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. It is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism by inactivating incretins like GLP-1, and it also plays a role in immune regulation.

3. IQCG is associated with the regulation of the calcium channel activity in sperm. It is involved in sperm motility and may play a role in male fertility.

4. ITSN1 is an adaptor protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular signaling. It has a role in synaptic vesicle cycling and may influence neurotransmitter release.

5. NFATC4, or Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 4, is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to signals that increase intracellular calcium. It plays a role in the immune response and cardiac hypertrophy.

6. PDP1, Pyruvate dehyrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 1, is involved in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle.

7. PIP5K1C synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a precursor of secondary messengers involved in signaling pathways, including those regulating cell growth, shape, and motility.

8. PLCD1 encodes phospholipase C delta 1, which hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), involved in calcium signaling and protein kinase C activation.

9. RCAN3 is part of the regulators of calcineurin (RCAN) family and modulates calcineurin signaling. It is implicated in the negative feedback of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway.

10. SLU7 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and is essential for the generation of proper 3' splice site selection.

11. TRPV6 is a member of the transient receptor potential cation channel family and is involved in calcium absorption in the intestine and kidney.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling and ion homeostasis. CEP41, ITSN1, PIP5K1C, PLCD1, and NFATC4 are all involved in different aspects of cellular signaling pathways, with a focus on calcium signaling and its downstream effects, including gene expression and neurotransmitter release. DPP4 has a role in glucose metabolism and immune regulation. IQCG and TRPV6 are involved in calcium channel activity and homeostasis, with implications for fertility and mineral absorption, respectively. PDP1 connects metabolic pathways by regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. RCAN3 and SLU7, while not directly involved in signaling, modulate signaling pathways and RNA processing, respectively, which can indirectly affect cellular responses to signals. The interplay of these proteins suggests a system that is primarily engaged in the regulation of intracellular signaling cascades and the maintenance of ion homeostasis, particularly calcium."	0.85	0	2/27	9.580444389134388e-05	0.0124545777058747	ITSN1;PIP5K1C	Clathrin-Dependent Endocytosis (GO:0072583)	Clathrin-Dependent Endocytosis 	GO:0072583	MAGI2 AP2B1 OCRL SNAP91 FCHSD2 PICALM GAK LMBRD1 SIGLEC1 DNAJC6 CANX GPR107 ITSN1 ITSN2 CLTC STON2 CLTB STON1 AP2A2 CLTA DLL1 FNBP1L FCHO2 FCHO1 AP2S1 PIP5K1C AP2M1	0.2891093	0.05555555555555555	0.18181818181818182	True	False

The KRTAP (Keratin Associated Protein) family members, including KRTAP2-4, KRTAP4-4, KRTAP4-11, KRTAP5-3, KRTAP5-6, KRTAP9-8, KRTAP10-3, and KRTAP10-7, are a group of proteins that are associated with the keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. They contribute to the formation of the hair shaft by determining its shape and rigidity. These proteins are rich in cysteine, which allows for the formation of disulfide bonds, leading to the highly cross-linked and resilient structure of hair keratin.

2. The LCE (Late Cornified Envelope) proteins, including LCE3A, LCE3B, LCE3C, and LCE4A, are expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis. They are involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a structure that provides a barrier to protect against environmental stressors, pathogens, and water loss. The LCE proteins are thought to play a role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which is a critical process in maintaining skin integrity and function.

3. SSC4D (Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen Recognized by T Cells 4D) is less directly related to the structural components of hair and skin but may be involved in immune responses in the skin. It is a serine protease inhibitor that can be overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting a role in the regulation of protease activity during skin pathology.

To summarize, the majority of the genes in this set encode proteins that are directly involved in the structural integrity and formation of hair and the epidermal barrier. They play crucial roles in keratinocyte differentiation and the establishment of the physical and protective properties of the skin and hair. The presence of SSC4D suggests a potential link to skin immune responses or pathology, but its role is less central to the primary process identified. The high confidence score reflects the strong thematic consistency among the KRTAP and LCE proteins in their contribution to keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal barrier formation."	0.92	0	3/75	1.4099210765050464e-05	3.081890532614508e-05	LCE3C;LCE3A;LCE3B	Defense Response To Gram-negative Bacterium (GO:0050829)	Defense Response To Gram-negative Bacterium 	GO:0050829	CHGA GSDMD DEFB104A DEFA5 DEFA6 RARRES2 DEFA3 DEFA4 MPEG1 AZU1 DEFA1 DEFB135 DEFB132 LYZ IL6 IL23A H2BC11 H2BC12 TLR9 TLR4 DEFB4A OPTN SERPINE1 EHHADH HMGB2 UMOD TREM1 DEFB1 TREM2 AQP1 PYCARD DROSHA ROMO1 CTSG TNFRSF14 CAMP ELANE DEFB119 DEFB118 SLC11A1 RNASE7 DEFB114 RNASE6 MR1 F2 DEFB106A IRGM RNASE3 RNASE2 SELP NLRP10 BPI GALP LTF FCN2 IGHM DEFB103A RPL30 IL23R DEFB128 DEFB127 DEFB126 LYPD8 DEFB107A LCE3B LCE3C CST11 LCE3A RPS19 DMBT1 PRB3 RNASE8 IL12B NOS2 IL6R	0.31560662	0.03529411764705882	0.23076923076923078	True	False

LYST, or lysosomal trafficking regulator, is involved in the regulation of lysosomal size and morphology. It plays a role in the sorting and trafficking of endosomal cargo destined for lysosomes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organelle function.

2. NRDE2 is less characterized but is thought to be involved in nuclear RNAi and may play a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, potentially influencing the stability or localization of specific mRNA transcripts.

3. REN, also known as renin, is primarily involved in blood pressure control and electrolyte balance. It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is not directly related to endosomal sorting but may be affected by vesicular trafficking processes.

4. SNRPA1 is a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein that is part of the spliceosome complex. It is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a process that occurs in the nucleus and is not directly related to endosomal sorting.

5. SNX6, SNX7, and SNX12 are members of the sorting nexin family. These proteins are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, playing roles in the retromer complex, which is responsible for the retrograde transport of cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.

6. SORT1, or sortilin, functions in the sorting of proteins to the lysosomes. It is involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes and may also play a role in neurotrophic signaling and apoptosis.

7. TMEM9, TMEM123, and TMEM189 are transmembrane proteins with less well-characterized functions. However, transmembrane proteins often play roles in cellular transport and signaling, potentially contributing to the trafficking system.

8. WASHC3 is part of the WASH complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting and the regulation of actin polymerization. It plays a role in the fission of transport intermediates from the endosomes.

9. WDFY1 is a WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein that is implicated in endosomal sorting and signaling pathways, potentially acting as an adaptor in the endosomal system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in the processes of endosomal sorting and trafficking, which are essential for the proper distribution and degradation of cellular components. While not all proteins are directly linked to this process, the preponderance of sorting nexins and related proteins suggests a strong functional theme. The presence of proteins like REN and SNRPA1, which are not directly related to endosomal sorting, slightly lowers the confidence score. However, the overall function of the system appears to be centered on the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and the regulation of cargo sorting and trafficking within the cell."	0.85	0	5/180	6.779571429835313e-08	1.0372744287648029e-05	SORT1;SNX12;SNX7;SNX6;WASHC3	Endosomal Transport (GO:0016197)	Endosomal Transport 	GO:0016197	ANKRD27 PLEKHA3 ANKFY1 AP5B1 BLTP1 DCLK1 ZFYVE16 ACAP2 TMCC1 RAB35 UBE2O TBC1D23 SQSTM1 VPS29 TMEM87A TMEM87B STX16 ZFYVE9 AP5Z1 WASHC2C ASB15 SNX33 STX10 GGA1 STX12 WASHC2A LAPTM4B MICALL1 MICALL2 SNX27 VTI1B STX6 VTI1A STX5 YKT6 DENND5A RAB29 RAB11FIP3 RILP VPS16 RAB11FIP4 PLEKHJ1 REPS1 REPS2 TBC1D17 DENND2A BET1L MYO5B RASSF9 NSG1 SNF8 NSG2 WASH3P EHD1 EHD2 PICALM EHD3 EHD4 HGS PREPL CHMP2B CHMP3 CHMP2A CCDC22 VAMP3 VAMP4 WASHC5 ITSN1 ITSN2 CLEC16A DPY30 VPS26B ARHGAP1 ARL1 GCC2 VPS26C WASH2P MAGEL2 VPS26A CORO1C RHOBTB3 RAB43 BLOC1S1 BLOC1S2 CHMP1B CHMP1A TOM1 AP5S1 CCDC93 WASHC1 WASHC3 WASHC4 RAB6D EIPR1 CMTM6 EPS15L1 BAIAP3 PHETA1 RBSN PHETA2 ARL4C HEATR5B CALY PIKFYVE HEATR5A RAB7A VPS35L DENND1C ANXA8L1 TINAGL1 VPS4A DENND1B DENND1A VPS4B CLTC AGAP2 PTPN23 WASH4P AP5M1 SNX4 SNX5 SNX2 VPS50 SNX3 DENND10 VPS52 SNX1 VPS51 CLTCL1 VPS54 VPS53 ENTR1 EPS15 EVI5 RAB6B RAB6C SNX9 SNX6 RAB6A SNX7 RIC1 SPAG9 GBF1 SORT1 LMTK2 RAB11B RAB10 RGP1 RNF126 SNX17 TBC1D5 SNX18 RAB13 ALS2 RAB14 LAMTOR1 RAB9A RAB9B RAB17 ARF6 GOSR1 SLC66A2 WIPF3 ALMS1 WASH6P DCTN1 SNX12 RCSD1 CLN5 ALS2CL ARFRP1 ANXA8 ERC1 TRIM27 VPS35 ANKRD50 TBC1D10A TBC1D10B TBC1D10C VPS39	0.8152019	0.026595744680851064	0.38461538461538464	True	False

6. Cellular stress and immune response (e.g., IFI27L1, THEM5).

The diversity of these proteins' functions suggests that they are not collectively dedicated to a single, coherent biological process. Instead, they appear to represent a cross-section of cellular machinery, each contributing to distinct and separate pathways within the cell. The lack of a unifying theme or shared function among the majority of these proteins leads to the conclusion that they constitute a ""System of unrelated proteins.""

ACVR1B (Activin A receptor type-1B), ACVR1C (Activin A receptor type-1C), and ACVR2A (Activin A receptor type-2A) are receptors that belong to the TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-beta) superfamily. These receptors are involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. They are serine/threonine kinase receptors that mediate the cellular responses to members of the TGF-β superfamily such as activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).

2. ARHGAP29 is a GTPase-activating protein that negatively regulates Rho GTPases, which are involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. Rho GTPases are also known to interact with TGF-β signaling, suggesting a potential modulatory role of ARHGAP29 in this pathway.

3. GDF11 (Growth Differentiation Factor 11) and NBL1 (neuroblastoma 1, DAN family BMP antagonist) are members of the TGF-β superfamily. GDF11 has been shown to regulate anterior-posterior patterning and to modulate aging and regeneration processes. NBL1 acts as an antagonist in the TGF-β signaling pathway, which can modulate the activity of TGF-β family ligands.

4. TWSG1 (Twisted gastrulation BMP signaling modulator 1) is another protein that modulates BMP signaling, a branch of the TGF-β pathway. It can either enhance or inhibit BMP signaling depending on the context and the presence of other interacting proteins.

5. The remaining proteins, such as C17orf53, C18orf54, CCDC28B, CERK, CLEC1A, CNGB1, DCAF17, DNAJC27, and SYNJ2BP, do not have well-established direct roles in the TGF-β signaling pathway based on the current knowledge. However, they may contribute to the broader regulatory network that influences TGF-β signaling indirectly or in a context-dependent manner.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly or indirectly involved in the modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for a wide range of cellular processes, and its precise regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The proteins ACVR1B, ACVR1C, ACVR2A, GDF11, NBL1, and TWSG1 have clear roles in this pathway, while others like ARHGAP29 may modulate it through their effects on Rho GTPases. The involvement of the remaining proteins in this system is less clear, but they may still play supporting roles in the broader regulatory network affecting TGF-β signaling."	0.85	1	3/16	2.3372249917408985e-07	1.5075101196728796e-05	ACVR1C;ACVR1B;ACVR2A	Activin Receptor Signaling Pathway (GO:0032924)	Activin Receptor Signaling Pathway 	GO:0032924	SMAD3 SMAD2 SMAD4 BMP10 INHBA GDF2 INHBB ACVR1C GDF7 ACVR1B GDF6 TGFBR1 ACVR2B ACVR2A CFC1 HJV	0.57331765	0.10344827586206896	0.1875	True	True

2. CBLN2 is involved in synapse integrity and neuronal communication, while proteins like KCNJ13, KCNK5, and KCNT2 are potassium channels with roles in maintaining the membrane potential and regulating neuronal excitability.

3. GH1 (Growth Hormone 1) plays a critical role in growth, metabolism, and development, whereas GREM2 (Gremlin 2) is involved in developmental processes and antagonizes bone morphogenetic proteins.

4. GRPR (Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor) is a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including cell signaling in the gastrointestinal tract.

5. Proteins like MEGF9 and PCDH8 (Protocadherin 8) are implicated in cell adhesion and signaling, which are essential for tissue organization and integrity.

2194	10	NeST	Cluster2-146	Cluster2-146	BBC3 CC2D1A PMAIP1	3	Apoptotic Signaling Pathway	"1. BBC3, also known as PUMA, is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. It is involved in p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis triggered by various stimuli, including DNA damage and growth factor deprivation. BBC3 acts by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, neutralizing their protective effect and thus promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is a critical step in apoptosis.

2. PMAIP1, known as NOXA, is another pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Similar to BBC3, it is implicated in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is regulated by p53. PMAIP1 preferentially binds to MCL1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and targets it for proteasomal degradation, thereby tipping the balance towards apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

3. CC2D1A is a transcriptional co-regulator that has been implicated in neural development and is known to interact with the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A. While its direct role in apoptosis is less clear compared to BBC3 and PMAIP1, it has been associated with signaling pathways that can influence cell survival and apoptosis indirectly.

The proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. BBC3 and PMAIP1 are direct effectors of apoptosis, promoting cell death in response to stress signals. CC2D1A's role is less direct, but it may modulate apoptotic signaling through its interactions with other proteins. The majority of the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into the process of apoptosis, with a strong emphasis on the regulation of cell death through the intrinsic pathway."	0.9	10	1/5	0.0007498314718703	0.0042263228414512	PMAIP1	Positive Regulation Of Extrinsic Apoptotic Signaling Pathway Via Death Domain Receptors (GO:1902043)	Positive Regulation Of Extrinsic Apoptotic Signaling Pathway Via Death Domain Receptors 	GO:1902043	TIMP3 PTEN PMAIP1 THBS1 SFRP1	0.54852116	0.14285714285714285	0.3333333333333333	True	True

BTBD2, CUL4B, DCAF6, DCAF10, DCAF11, DCAF16, RNF7, and ZER1 are components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). They are involved in the targeted degradation of proteins through ubiquitination, which is a post-translational modification where ubiquitin proteins are attached to a substrate protein, marking it for degradation by the proteasome. CUL4B is a core component of the cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which recruits substrates through specific adaptors such as DCAF proteins. RNF7 acts as a ring finger protein that can enhance the ubiquitination activity of the complex.

2. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that has a well-established role in the regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor, thus participating in cell cycle control and apoptosis. It can also be involved in the UPS through its ubiquitin ligase activity.

3. SENP3 is a SUMO-specific protease involved in the deSUMOylation process, which can indirectly affect ubiquitination pathways by altering the SUMOylation status of proteins that are also targets for ubiquitination.

4. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins and the stabilization of a number of client proteins, many of which are involved in signal transduction and protection against stress. It can interact with the UPS by stabilizing proteins before they are ubiquitinated or by refolding ubiquitinated proteins that have been targeted for degradation.

5. TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction. It can influence the UPS by promoting the degradation of IκB, leading to the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses.

6. UBXN1 and UBXN7 are members of the UBX domain-containing protein family, which can interact with the p97/VCP segregase, a protein involved in the extraction of ubiquitinated proteins from membranes or protein complexes in preparation for their degradation by the proteasome.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein quality control, regulation of cell cycle, and various signaling pathways. Additionally, they play roles in the cellular stress response, particularly in the context of protein folding and inflammation. The system exhibits a high degree of functional integration, with multiple proteins contributing to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, as well as the regulation of these processes through chaperoning and deSUMOylation."	0.89	0	5/220	4.224367723956872e-07	0.0001668625250962	UBXN1;MDM2;UBXN7;DCAF11;CUL4B	Proteasomal Protein Catabolic Process (GO:0010498)	Proteasomal Protein Catabolic Process 	GO:0010498	ATE1 PEX10 ARMC8 PEX12 PML PSMC6 APC PSMC4 IFI27 PSMC5 PSMC2 PSMC3 NHLRC1 PSMC1 RBCK1 NHLRC3 ASB2 TRIM13 RNF5 RNF4 FBXL22 MTA1 PSMD7 PSMD8 PSMD6 PSMD3 PSMD4 PSMD1 PSMD2 TBL1X BTRC RFFL SIAH1 XBP1 SIAH3 SIAH2 NR1D1 TOPORS PSME4 ATF6 NEDD4L KAT5 RNF216 PCBP2 SKP1 SKP2 CSNK1A1 SIRT1 SIRT2 UBE2G1 KBTBD6 KBTBD7 PRPF19 BMAL1 UBXN1 WDR26 ZFAND2A SEL1L ZFAND2B KIF14 TRIM2 TRIM9 ANKRD9 ATXN3 SH3BGRL UCHL1 TRIM3 UBXN7 SOCS6 UBXN6 APC2 WWP1 SYVN1 UBE4B WWP2 ITCH GID4 PSMA6 SPSB4 DDB1 PSMA7 SPSB3 PSMA4 SPSB2 PSMA5 RNF126 SPSB1 GID8 PSMA2 PSMA3 PSMA1 PELI1 TRIP12 RNF122 FAF1 CTNNB1 DERL1 PSMA8 PSMB7 PRAMEF6 PSMB5 PSMB6 PSMB3 PSMB4 RNF139 ENC1 PSMB1 PSMB2 PRAME ZSWIM8 PRAMEF9 MARCHF6 FBXW5 KLHDC3 FBXW7 FBXW11 CRBN KLHDC2 KLHL22 UBE2A UBE2B KLHL20 RBX1 RNF41 NSFL1C UBE2W TBL1XR1 UBXN11 DNAJB12 RNF185 RNF187 UBE2K RNF186 PLAA PRKN RNF34 UBE3D UBXN2B UBE2D3 UBXN2A PCNP TBX21 SPOP USP44 APPBP2 RCAN3 BIRC2 MDM2 TRIM72 BRSK2 VCP CUL3 TRIM71 CUL1 MAEA SEL1L2 RHOBTB3 BAG6 COP1 PMAIP1 SMURF2 SMURF1 RHBDD1 AXIN2 PPP2R5C AXIN1 RAD23B BFAR RAD23A PJA2 CUL4B CUL4A SPOPL NFE2L2 PSMD11 GSK3B PSMD13 GSK3A PSMD12 PSMD14 AGAP3 LOC122513141 TNFAIP1 DTX4 FBXO44 FBXO45 SHARPIN ERLEC1 DDI2 DDI1 FEM1B FEM1C FBXL19 KCTD2 FBXL17 KCTD5 KLHL42 CDC34 KCTD10 ERCC8 DDIT3 KCTD13 STUB1 CLOCK KCTD17 CCDC47 ARRB2 AMBRA1 TNFSF13B ZNRF1 ZNRF2 HECTD1 RMND5A RMND5B HECTD3 ARRB1 FBXO7 DCAF11 FBXO9 TRIM21	0.50631064	0.021739130434782608	0.3333333333333333	True	False

ARHGAP21 is a GTPase-activating protein that interacts with the small GTPase Cdc42, which is involved in various cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton organization, cell shape, and cell migration. ARHGAP21 has been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion and may indirectly influence gene expression by modulating the cytoskeleton and cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix.

2. CDC27 is a core component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a large E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates various stages of the cell cycle. The APC/C is crucial for the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis and the exit from mitosis into the G1 phase. It targets cell cycle regulators such as cyclins and securin for proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling cell cycle transitions.

3. CTNNA2 encodes alpha-catenin, a protein that links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton in adherens junctions, which are important for cell-cell adhesion. While its primary role is structural, it can also influence signaling pathways that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation.

4. HDAC1 is a histone deacetylase involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. By removing acetyl groups from histone tails, HDAC1 condenses chromatin structure, which generally suppresses gene expression. It can also deacetylate non-histone proteins, affecting their function and stability.

5. SOX2 is a transcription factor critical for maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. It regulates gene expression programs that are essential for self-renewal and can also influence cell fate decisions during development. SOX2 has been shown to interact with chromatin-modifying enzymes, including HDAC1, to regulate gene expression.

6. USP7, also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can remove ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby preventing their degradation by the proteasome. It has several substrates, including p53 and MDM2, which are key regulators of the cell cycle and apoptosis. USP7 can modulate chromatin structure indirectly through its regulation of histone ubiquitination.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression (HDAC1, SOX2), as well as the progression and regulation of the cell cycle (CDC27, USP7). ARHGAP21 and CTNNA2, while primarily associated with cytoskeletal and cell adhesion functions, can indirectly influence gene expression and cell proliferation. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated role in ensuring proper cell cycle progression and maintaining the integrity of gene expression programs, particularly in contexts where cell adhesion and chromatin structure are dynamically regulated."	0.85	22	1/5	0.0014992198216206	0.0250272381907666	USP7	Negative Regulation Of Gene Expression Via CpG Island Methylation (GO:0044027)	Negative Regulation Of Gene Expression Via CpG Island Methylation 	GO:0044027	HELLS USP7 UHRF2 UHRF1 ZNF445	0.31483042	0.1	0.16666666666666666	True	True

GTF3C3 is a subunit of the general transcription factor IIIC complex that is involved in the transcription of tRNA and other small RNA genes by RNA polymerase III. It plays a role in the assembly of the transcription complex and recruitment of RNA polymerase III to gene promoters.

2. MSI2 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation and stability of target mRNAs. It is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation and maintenance of stem cell populations.

3. PABPC1 and PABPC4 are poly(A) binding proteins that bind to the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules, thereby contributing to the regulation of translation initiation, mRNA stability, and polyadenylation. They play a role in the control of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.

4. PAPOLG is a poly(A) polymerase that adds a poly(A) tail to the 3' end of RNA molecules, which is important for mRNA stability and efficient translation. It is involved in the maturation of pre-mRNA into functional mRNA.

5. PPP1CC is a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1, which is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes through dephosphorylation of target proteins. It can influence various aspects of mRNA metabolism and translation through its effects on protein phosphorylation.

6. RANGAP1 is a GTPase-activating protein for RAN, a small GTP-binding protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. It plays a role in the transport of RNA and proteins across the nuclear envelope, which is essential for gene expression regulation.

7. RPL4 is a component of the ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis. Ribosomes translate mRNA into polypeptide chains, thus playing a central role in gene expression.

8. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is involved in the maintenance of telomere length, which is not directly related to gene expression but is crucial for chromosome stability and cellular lifespan, indirectly affecting gene expression patterns over time.

9. WWOX is a tumor suppressor protein that can interact with various transcription factors and modulate their activity. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in RNA processing.

10. ZC3H3 is a zinc finger protein that is thought to be involved in mRNA processing, particularly in mRNA export from the nucleus.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in various stages of gene expression, including transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA stability, translation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. While TERT is more indirectly related through its role in telomere maintenance, the other proteins contribute more directly to the regulation of gene expression and mRNA stability. The system reflects a complex interplay of factors that ensure proper gene expression patterns are maintained for cellular function."	0.85	0	2/24	7.540109655030562e-05	0.0051438958888054	PAPOLG;PABPC1	mRNA Polyadenylation (GO:0006378)	mRNA Polyadenylation 	GO:0006378	APP PNPT1 HEXIM1 CPSF2 CPSF1 CPSF3 CSTF3 PEX2 TENT4B CDC73 WDR33 MTPAP SCAF8 PCF11 PAPOLG SSU72 PAPOLB LEO1 PAPOLA PABPC1 SYMPK TENT2 TUT1 GRSF1	0.44793823	0.06060606060606061	0.18181818181818182	True	False

ACER3 (Alkaline Ceramidase 3) is involved in the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine, a process that occurs at an alkaline pH. This reaction is part of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.

2. CERS2 (Ceramide Synthase 2), CERS4 (Ceramide Synthase 4), CERS5 (Ceramide Synthase 5), and CERS6 (Ceramide Synthase 6) are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of ceramides. They catalyze the formation of ceramide from sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoA, which is a central step in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Each of these enzymes has specificity for acyl-CoA of different chain lengths, contributing to the diversity of ceramide species in membranes.

3. FA2H (Fatty Acid 2-Hydroxylase) is involved in the hydroxylation of sphingolipid and fatty acid components of myelin. This modification is important for the stability and function of myelin sheaths in the nervous system.

4. PFDN2 (Prefoldin Subunit 2) is part of the prefoldin complex, which is involved in the folding of proteins upon their synthesis. While not directly related to sphingolipid metabolism, proper protein folding is essential for the function of all enzymes, including those involved in lipid metabolism.

5. SLC36A1 (Solute Carrier Family 36 Member 1) is a proton-coupled amino acid transporter. Although not directly involved in sphingolipid metabolism, amino acid transport can be linked to overall cellular homeostasis and may indirectly affect the metabolism of sphingolipids through regulation of cellular growth and protein synthesis.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in the synthesis and degradation of sphingolipids, which are essential components of cell membranes and play a significant role in signaling pathways. The presence of PFDN2 suggests a general role in protein homeostasis, which is necessary for the proper function of all cellular processes, including lipid metabolism. SLC36A1, while not directly related to sphingolipid metabolism, may have an indirect role in cellular homeostasis. The system predominantly reflects the processes of sphingolipid metabolism and homeostasis, with a strong emphasis on the synthesis and modification of ceramides, which are central to the sphingolipid pathway."	0.85	0	6/55	9.095709841801816e-15	3.301305067501828e-13	CERS4;FA2H;CERS5;CERS6;ACER3;CERS2	Ceramide Metabolic Process (GO:0006672)	Ceramide Metabolic Process 	GO:0006672	TLCD3B AGK PPP2R1A DEGS2 DEGS1 NSMAF ASAH2 SAMD8 ST6GALNAC3 SGMS2 CERK SGMS1 ALOX12B CYP4F22 FUT3 ASAH1 FUT5 FUT7 FUT6 SGPL1 ORMDL3 SPTSSA SPTSSB ALOXE3 ABCA2 CERS4 CERS5 CERS6 GDF1 CEL ORMDL1 ORMDL2 PPP2CA ACER3 FA2H ACER2 TM9SF2 ACER1 PLA2G15 PLPP3 PNPLA1 CERS2 PLPP2 ST6GALNAC6 CERS3 PLPP1 GBA1 CLN8 CLN6 SMPD4 SPTLC1 SPTLC2 SPTLC3 SMPD2 SMPD1	0.7865001	0.10526315789473684	0.75	True	True

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular functions, including but not limited to:

1. Gene regulation and transcriptional control, as suggested by the presence of several zinc finger proteins (ZNF587B, ZNF736, ZNF783, ZNF852, ZNF888). Zinc finger proteins typically act as transcription factors, binding to DNA and regulating the expression of other genes. However, the specific targets and processes they regulate can be vastly different.

2. RNA processing and modification, indicated by proteins such as TRMT10A, which is an RNA methyltransferase, and TRNT1, which is involved in tRNA nucleotidyl transferase activity. These proteins contribute to the maturation and function of RNA molecules but do not necessarily point to a unified biological process.

3. Cellular transport and ion homeostasis, as seen with SLC9A3, which is a sodium/hydrogen exchanger, and PI4K2B, which is involved in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity. These proteins are important for maintaining cellular ion balance and membrane dynamics but are part of distinct transport systems.

4. DNA repair and replication, with proteins like ZRANB3, which is involved in DNA damage response and replication stress, and TERT, which is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, responsible for maintaining telomere length.

5. Protein modification and signaling, such as TIFA, which is involved in immune signaling pathways, and PPIP5K1, which is a kinase involved in inositol pyrophosphate synthesis.

6. PSMD1 is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, which is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The proteasome plays a pivotal role in maintaining protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular function.

7. HDAC6 is a histone deacetylase that has a broader substrate specificity and is involved in the deacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tubulin. It is implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and also plays a role in cellular stress responses by coordinating the aggresome pathway, which sequesters misfolded proteins.

8. HSPA1B is a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, which acts as molecular chaperones facilitating the folding of newly synthesized proteins, the refolding of misfolded proteins, and the degradation of proteins that can no longer be salvaged. It is also involved in protecting cells from stress.

9. EEF1A1 is an elongation factor that plays a central role in the elongation step during protein synthesis by the ribosome. It is also known to interact with actin and the cytoskeleton and has been implicated in various non-canonical functions, including apoptosis and the cellular stress response.

GYG1 (Glycogenin-1) and GYS1 (Glycogen Synthase 1) are directly involved in glycogen synthesis. GYG1 acts as a primer for glycogen synthesis, initiating the core structure to which glucose residues are added. GYS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, responsible for the elongation of the glycogen chain by adding glucose units.

2. PPP1R3B (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3B) and PPP1R3C (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3C) are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase, thus promoting glycogen synthesis. PPP1R3B is known to be specific for the liver and PPP1R3C for skeletal muscle, indicating tissue-specific regulation of glycogen metabolism.

3. PPP1R11 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Inhibitor Subunit 11) and PPP1R37 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 37) are also associated with PP1, but their precise roles in glycogen metabolism are less clear. They may modulate the activity of PP1 in different contexts, potentially influencing glycogen storage or mobilization.

4. AATK (Apoptosis-Associated Tyrosine Kinase) and LMTK2 (Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2) are kinases that could be involved in signaling pathways that indirectly affect glycogen metabolism, although their direct roles in this process are not well established.

5. SNCAIP (Synuclein Alpha Interacting Protein) has been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and may have indirect effects on glycogen metabolism through neuronal signaling pathways.

6. The remaining proteins, such as C2orf74, C20orf27, CBARP, CCDC85B, CNST, CSRNP1, CSRNP2, ERBIN, NHLRC1, NNAT, PHACTR3, and the ZFYVE family members, do not have well-established roles in glycogen metabolism. Their inclusion in this analysis is based on less direct evidence or potential regulatory interactions that have yet to be fully characterized.

In summary, the primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of glycogen metabolism, with a focus on glycogen synthesis. The system includes key enzymes directly responsible for glycogen synthesis, regulatory subunits that modulate the activity of these enzymes, and additional proteins that may influence glycogen metabolism through signaling pathways or indirect interactions. The confidence score reflects the fact that while several proteins in the system are directly involved in glycogen metabolism, others have less clear roles or are involved in broader regulatory functions that may only peripherally impact this process."	0.85	0	4/9	1.377638336905611e-10	8.472475771969507e-09	GYS1;PPP1R3C;NHLRC1;GYG1	Glucan Biosynthetic Process (GO:0009250)	Glucan Biosynthetic Process 	GO:0009250	GYS2 PER2 UGP2 PPP1R3C NR1D1 NHLRC1 GYG1 GYG2 GYS1	0.49767905	0.14814814814814814	0.18181818181818182	True	True

2. AHSA1, CDC37L1, CHORDC1, HGH1, HSPA4, and TOMM34 are proteins associated with the molecular chaperone machinery. HSPA4 is a heat shock protein that assists in protein folding and protects cells from stress. AHSA1 acts as a co-chaperone that interacts with HSP90, affecting its chaperone activity. CDC37L1 and CHORDC1 are also co-chaperones that interact with HSP90, playing roles in protein folding and stabilization of specific client proteins. HGH1 is involved in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. TOMM34 is a co-chaperone that assists in the translocation of preproteins into mitochondria.

3. ARAF and RAF1 are part of the RAF kinase family, which plays a role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cellular growth, and survival. LRRK2 is a kinase associated with several signaling pathways, including those regulating neurite outgrowth and cell proliferation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in two main biological processes: signal transduction, particularly through the TGF-beta/SMAD and MAPK/ERK pathways, and protein folding, with a focus on the HSP90 chaperone system and its co-chaperones. These processes are crucial for proper cellular function and response to environmental stress. The proteins work together to ensure that signaling pathways are correctly regulated and that proteins achieve their proper conformation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis."	0.85	0	2/5	2.7474478975315667e-06	0.0006181757769446	ACVR2B;ACVR2A	Positive Regulation Of Activin Receptor Signaling Pathway (GO:0032927)	Positive Regulation Of Activin Receptor Signaling Pathway 	GO:0032927	SMAD2 CSNK2B NODAL ACVR2B ACVR2A	0.31018633	0.14285714285714285	0.18181818181818182	True	True

SIGLEC7 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (siglecs) family, which are typically involved in cell-cell interactions and signaling through recognition of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates. It is primarily found on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and plays a role in the inhibition of NK cell activation, thus contributing to immune regulation.

2. C11ORF85, also known as hydrocephalus-inducing protein homolog (HYDIN2), is a poorly characterized protein with limited available functional data. It is believed to be a paralog of the HYDIN gene, which is involved in ciliary function and is associated with hydrocephalus due to its role in the motility of cilia in the brain.

3. PPL, or periplakin, is a component of the cornified envelope of keratinocytes and is involved in linking the cytoskeleton to the intercellular junctions in epithelial cells. It plays a role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells and is implicated in the maintenance of skin barrier function.

4. NTN1, or netrin 1, is a secreted protein involved in axon guidance during neural development. It interacts with receptors on the surface of neurons to guide axon growth and cell migration. Netrin 1 also has roles outside the nervous system, including in angiogenesis and the regulation of epithelial cell behavior.

5. ZNF181 is a member of the zinc finger protein family, which typically acts as transcription factors binding to DNA and regulating gene expression. The specific functions of ZNF181 are not well characterized, but zinc finger proteins are generally involved in developmental processes and cellular differentiation.

1. Signal Transduction: Proteins like ITGAV (integrin subunit alpha V) and ARHGEF12 (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 12) are involved in signal transduction pathways that mediate cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Similarly, ADCY9 (adenylate cyclase 9) is involved in the generation of cAMP, a second messenger important in many biological processes.

2. Gene Regulation: RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor critical for hematopoietic differentiation, while BATF2 (basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 2) is involved in the regulation of immune response genes. DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns, which is crucial for epigenetic regulation.

3. Metabolism: Enzymes like CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) are involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis, while SLC16A7 (solute carrier family 16 member 7) is a monocarboxylate transporter, which plays a role in lactate transport and metabolism.

6. Stress Response and Chaperones: HSPB9 (heat shock protein family B (small) member 9) is a small heat shock protein that may play a role in stress resistance and act as a chaperone.

7. Transport and Trafficking: ABCC2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 2) is involved in the transport of various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes.

Several proteins in this system, such as CDC45, CCNF, AURKA, ASF1B, FANCI, CCNB1, KIF2C, CEP170, and ERCC6L, are directly involved in cell cycle regulation and progression. CDC45 is a key player in the initiation of DNA replication, while cyclin F (CCNF) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are essential for the regulation of different phases of the cell cycle. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is critical for mitotic spindle assembly, and KIF2C is involved in chromosome segregation.

2. Proteins like EXO1, DEPDC1B, and FANCI are associated with DNA repair mechanisms. EXO1 is a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair and recombination, while FANCI is part of the Fanconi anemia pathway, crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. DEPDC1B has been implicated in the regulation of cell division and may have a role in the DNA damage response.

3. The presence of proteins such as ERCC6L, a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair, and ASF1B, which is important for chromatin assembly and disassembly during DNA replication and repair, further supports the involvement of this system in DNA damage response and repair.

4. The system also includes proteins like TAF12, which is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, playing a role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and thus indirectly influencing cell cycle progression.

5. Additionally, proteins such as MYO5A, involved in organelle and vesicle transport, and AQP9, a water channel protein, suggest roles in cellular homeostasis and metabolism that can be critical for cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally interconnected through their roles in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage response. The system appears to be primarily oriented towards ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic integrity, with additional roles in transcription regulation and cellular transport mechanisms that support these primary functions."	0.92	0	4/52	0.0001085953794939	0.0831840606923408	DEPDC1B;ECT2;TANK;TSPYL5	Cellular Response To Ionizing Radiation (GO:0071479)	Cellular Response To Ionizing Radiation 	GO:0071479	KDM4D HUS1 LIG4 SIRT1 RHOB SPIDR MAPK14 DEPDC1B EEF1D RPL26 RHNO1 ATR TP53 YAP1 KDM1A SWI5 BRCA1 BRCA2 TANK BABAM2 RAD51AP1 PRAP1 HSF1 IFI16 ECT2 MAP3K20 XRCC5 XRCC6 GADD45A INO80 RAD51 ERCC4 GRB2 INTS7 CRYAB CLOCK RAD9A TSPYL5 MDM2 RAD9B BLM CDKN1A NUCKS1 SLC6A2 NIPBL WRN FIGNL1 TMEM109 TLK2 HRAS TNKS1BP1 BARD1	0.5655439	0.027972027972027972	0.042105263157894736	True	False

1. Several proteins like SLC39A5 and SLC5A12 are transporters, indicating roles in ion and nutrient transport, but they do not suggest a unified process.

2. Signal transduction is represented by proteins such as EPHB1 and IRS1, which are involved in different signaling pathways and do not point to a single, cohesive biological process.

3. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like HEY2 and MEIS2, but they regulate diverse sets of genes and are involved in various developmental and cellular processes.

4. Proteins involved in protein synthesis, such as MRPL47 and RPS16P5, are essential for general cellular function and do not define a specific biological process within this system.

5. Cell structure and motility are influenced by proteins like DPYSL5 and SHROOM2, but again, these proteins are involved in different aspects of cellular architecture and movement.

6. Apoptosis and metabolism are represented by proteins such as PDCD6 and FAAH2, respectively, but these proteins are part of broader cellular functions and do not align to a single process.

The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.

2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.

3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.

4. Proteins such as SLC34A1, SLC15A3, and SLC23A2 are transporters that facilitate the movement of specific substrates across cellular membranes. SLC34A1 is a phosphate transporter, SLC15A3 is a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, and SLC23A2 is a vitamin C transporter.

5. The presence of proteins like IDH3A, LDHB, and GYS1 indicates involvement in metabolic processes. IDH3A is a subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase involved in the TCA cycle, LDHB is involved in lactate metabolism, and GYS1 is glycogen synthase, which plays a role in glycogen biosynthesis.

6. Proteins such as OPTN, CEACAM1, and PLAUR are implicated in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions. OPTN is involved in autophagy and NF-κB signaling, CEACAM1 participates in cell adhesion and signaling, and PLAUR (uPAR) is involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling.

To summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.

Given the complexity and diversity of the protein functions, the confidence score is not at the maximum, as not all proteins are directly involved in the identified processes. However, the prominence of the innate immune response and apoptosis regulation components justifies a relatively high confidence score."	0.85	0	8/148	4.452441312535884e-07	0.0003606477463154	ISG20;RTP4;IFIH1;IRF1;STAT2;TLR3;RELA;IFIT2	Defense Response To Symbiont (GO:0140546)	Defense Response To Symbiont 	GO:0140546	GBP7 RAB2B GARIN5A MX1 MX2 RSAD2 ACOD1 SLFN13 IFI44L CNOT7 SLFN11 ZNFX1 IFI27 CD207 TBKBP1 RNF185 RELA IFITM2 IFITM3 IFITM1 IFI6 TANK IFNL1 PYCARD IFNL3 NLRP9 EXOSC5 IFNL2 IFI16 NLRP6 NLRP1 EXOSC4 GBP2 IFNL4 MICA GBP5 AZI2 APOBEC3D AICDA APOBEC3F APOBEC3G APOBEC3H BNIP3L DDX56 TRAF3 ISG15 MOV10 ISG20 MYD88 MAVS NT5C3A PLSCR1 PDE12 BCL2L1 NDUFAF4 MAP3K14 APOBEC3A APOBEC3B RIGI ZCCHC3 APOBEC3C IFNAR2 FCN3 IFIT5 PRF1 IFIT2 IFIT1 DDX60 IFIT3 BPIFA1 TBK1 G3BP1 DHX15 PMAIP1 MLKL ATG7 SKP2 NCBP3 RIPK3 EIF2AK2 NCBP1 CARD8 IFNLR1 LILRB1 AZU1 OAS1 USP29 TLR2 BST2 IFNE IRF1 PTPRC IL6 OAS2 OAS3 IRF2 IRF3 BCL2 TLR9 TLR8 IRF7 TLR7 ZMYND11 SERINC3 TRIM56 SERINC5 TLR3 TRIM52 CD40 CGAS NLRC5 PQBP1 TRIM5 FADD CASP1 TRIM41 STAT1 STAT2 OPRK1 RNASE6 STING1 RNASE2 RNASE1 AGBL5 AIM2 AGBL4 DDIT4 IFIT1B PLA2G10 TTC4 F2RL1 SHFL USP27X IL21 RNASEL RTP4 TRIM31 IFNA2 DDX60L LYST OASL SAMHD1 IFIH1 BNIP3 IGF2BP1 IFNB1 SETD2 IKBKE	0.4792131	0.034334763948497854	0.08602150537634409	True	False

WDR16, or WD repeat domain 16, is a protein that is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and may play a role in autophagy. The specific functions of WDR16 are not well-characterized, but given its domain structure, it is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate signal transduction pathways or assembly of protein complexes.

2. GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to internal signaling pathways. The gamma subunit, along with the beta subunit, forms a complex that interacts with the alpha subunit and receptors. GNG12 is implicated in the modulation of various signaling cascades, including those that regulate cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and possibly angiogenesis.

3. NSMAF, also known as neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activation associated factor, is involved in the ceramide signaling pathway. Ceramide is a lipid molecule that acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling cascades, particularly those related to stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis. NSMAF is thought to be involved in the activation of N-SMase, which leads to the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, intracellular transport, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Signal transduction and cellular communication are represented by proteins like FGF19 (a member of the fibroblast growth factor family with roles in bile acid synthesis regulation and metabolic homeostasis), EFNB2 (a member of the ephrin family involved in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system), and GPRC5A (a G protein-coupled receptor with potential roles in cancer development).

2. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like GABPA (a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular growth control), RBM39 (an RNA-binding protein implicated in splicing), and TRIM66 (a tripartite motif-containing protein that may function as a transcriptional regulator).

3. Intracellular transport and cellular organization are represented by proteins such as KIF18A (a kinesin involved in mitotic spindle assembly), STARD4 (involved in cholesterol trafficking), and CAPZA3 (a capping protein regulating actin filament dynamics).
