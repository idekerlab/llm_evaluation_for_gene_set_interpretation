comment: Radial spokes are involved in some types of beating motions of the cilium. The radial spoke is usually a T-shaped structure comprised of a short base that attaches to the A-microtubule of an axonemal outer microtubule doublet (MTD) of a cilium, an elongated stalk, a neck complex, and an orthogonal head structure that extends perpendicularly towards the inner sheath and the central pair (CP) microtubules. Groups of radial spokes (RSs) repeat along the MTD with regular spacing. In most organisms, each group of radial spokes is comprised of a triplet of spokes: RS1, RS2, and RS3. In some organisms (e.g. Chlamydomonas and Sarcophaga bullata), each group contains a doublet of radial spokes: RS1 and RS2, while RS3 is represented only as a stump (referred to as RS3S) attached to the A-microtubule but lacking the rest of the stalk structure and entirely lacking the head structure. {xref="PMID:9450971", xref="GOC:krc", xref="PMID:34871179", xref="PMID:25694453"}

comment: Note that podosomes can be distinguished from other F-actin-rich structures or from other matrix contacts.

However, most of the podosome ring components are found in focal adhesions and other cell-matrix contacts. Podosomes are typically found in cells that cross tissue boundaries, recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells, and are often sites of extracellular matrix degradation.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

This binds both to the N-terminal signal peptide for proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum as they emerge from the large ribosomal subunit and also to the ribosome. This binding arrests further translation thereby preventing the proteins from being released into the cytosol. The SRP-ribosome complex then diffuses to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is bound to the signal recognition particle receptor, which allows resumption of protein synthesis and facilitates the passage of the growing polypeptide chain through the translocon. Through a process involving GTP hydrolysis, the SRP-SRP receptor complex dissociates and SRP returns to the cytosol. Of the six polypeptides of SRP the 54 kDa subunit (SRP54) is the central player. It contains an N-terminal GTPase domain and a C-terminal domain that binds directly to the signal peptide and the SRP RNA.

It contains nine short, parallel, peripheral microtubular fibrils, each fibril consisting of one complete microtubule fused to two incomplete microtubules. Cells usually have two centrioles, lying at right angles to each other. At division, each pair of centrioles generates another pair and the twin pairs form the pole of the mitotic spindle."

comment: In most eukaryotic cells, 'ciliary basal body' (GO:0036064) and 'centriole' (GO:0005814) represent a common entity that cycles through its function in cell division, then ciliogenesis, then cell division again. However, these structures are modified extensively as they transition into each other, and may contain different proteins, specific to each component.

name: cytoplasmic dynein complex

def: "Any dynein complex with a homodimeric dynein heavy chain core that catalyzes movement along a microtubule. Cytoplasmic dynein complexes participate in many cytoplasmic transport activities in eukaryotes, such as mRNA localization, intermediate filament transport, nuclear envelope breakdown, apoptosis, transport of centrosomal proteins, mitotic spindle assembly, virus transport, kinetochore functions, and movement of signaling and spindle checkpoint proteins. Some complexes participate in intraflagellar transport. Subunits associated with the dynein heavy chain mediate association between dynein heavy chain and cargoes, and may include light chains and light intermediate chains." [GOC:cilia, GOC:hla, GOC:krc, GOC:mah, PMID:12600311]
comment: Note that this term is labelled based on phylogenetic classification and community usage, rather than strict cellular localization. Cytoplasmic dynein complexes may contain ciliary dyneins; therefore the term is not linked to 'cytoplasm'. Cytoplasmic dynein complexes do not contain axonemal dyneins; see GO:0005858 axonemal dynein complex.

comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent. In most eukaryotic species, intracellular sub-components of the cilium, such as the ciliary base and rootlet, are located near the plasma membrane. In Diplomonads such as Giardia, instead, the same ciliary parts are located further intracellularly. Also, 'cilium' may be used when axonemal structure and/or motility are unknown, or when axonemal structure is unusual. For all other cases, please refer to children of 'cilium'. Finally, note that any role of ciliary proteins in sensory events should be captured by annotating to relevant biological process terms.

def: "A membranous cellular structure that bears the photosynthetic pigments in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. In cyanobacteria thylakoids are of various shapes and are attached to, or continuous with, the plasma membrane. In eukaryotes they are flattened, membrane-bounded disk-like structures located in the chloroplasts; in the chloroplasts of higher plants the thylakoids form dense stacks called grana. Isolated thylakoid preparations can carry out photosynthetic electron transport and the associated phosphorylation." [GOC:ds, GOC:mtg_sensu, ISBN:0198506732]
comment: A thylakoid is not considered an organelle, but some thylakoids are part of organelles.

Two major types have been characterized: V-type ATPases couple ATP hydrolysis to the transport of protons across a concentration gradient, whereas F-type ATPases, also known as ATP synthases, normally run in the reverse direction to utilize energy from a proton concentration or electrochemical gradient to synthesize ATP. A third type, A-type ATPases have been found in archaea, and are closely related to eukaryotic V-type ATPases but are reversible." [GOC:mah, ISBN:0716743663, PMID:16691483]

The ionotropic glutamate receptor complex itself acts as a ligand gated ion channel; on binding glutamate, charged ions pass through a channel in the center of the receptor complex. NMDA receptors are composed of assemblies of NR1 subunits (Figure 3) and NR2 subunits, which can be one of four separate gene products (NR2A-D). Expression of both subunits are required to form functional channels. The glutamate binding domain is formed at the junction of NR1 and NR2 subunits. NMDA receptors are permeable to calcium ions as well as being permeable to other ions. Thus NMDA receptor activation leads to a calcium influx into the post-synaptic cells, a signal thought to be crucial for the induction of NMDA-receptor dependent LTP and LTD."

If the recognition site is hemimethylated, the complex acts as a methyltransferase which modifies the recognition site, using S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. Only the M and S subunits are required for this reaction. If the complex binds to an unmethylated recognition site, then the complex translocates the DNA bidirectionally in an ATP-dependent manner. When the translocation is stalled by impact with another complex or unusual DNA structure, the enzyme functions as an endonuclease and cleavage of the DNA will occur, hundreds or thousands of base pairs away from the recognition site.

def: "A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together." [GOC:dos, GOC:mah]
comment: A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.

The axoneme extends through the ciliary transition zone, but only consists of the outer doublets. The central pair, axonemal spokes, and dynein complexes are not found in this part of the ciliary shaft. Note that the connecting cilium of the photoreceptor cells is thought to be equivalent to the transition zone.

However, these structures are modified extensively as they transition into each other, and may contain different proteins, specific to each component.

During epididymal transit, the cytoplasmic droplet migrates caudally to the annulus at the end of the midpiece; the exact position and time varies by species. The cytoplasmic droplet consists of lipids, lipoproteins, RNAs, a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, receptors, ion channels, and Golgi-derived vesicles. The droplet may be involved in regulatory volume loss (RVD) at ejaculation, and in most species, though not in humans, the cytoplasmic droplet is lost at ejaculation.

def: "The cilary pro-basal body is an immature, partially assembled form of a ciliary basal body found next to the basal body of a cilium. Pro-basal bodies are not capable of nucleating a cilium. As the cell progresses through the cell cycle, continuing assembly will convert the pro-basal body into a mature basal body that is capable of nucleating a cilium." [ISBN:0198547684]
comment: Pro-basal bodies are distinct from basal bodies as they are not at the base of a cilium and are not capable of nucleating a cilium. While immature, they contain some structures in common with the mature basal body and also may contain proteins unique to the immature state. Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent. In many eukaryotic cells, 'ciliary basal body' (GO:0036064) and 'centriole' (GO:0005814) represent a common entity that cycles through its function in cell division, then ciliogenesis, then cell division again. However, these structures are modified extensively as they transition into each other, and may contain different proteins, specific to each component. In other eukaryotic cells, centrioles are not involved in cell division but only in cilium assembly, which is thought to be the ancestral role of the centriole/basal body.

comment: Note that a 'flagellar collar' is described in Choanoflagellates, but this is different from the ciliary pocket collar found e.g. in Giardia; in Choanoflagellates, a single apical flagellum is surrounded by a collar of 30-40 microvilli.

comment: Within the Wnt signalosome, beta-catenin phosphorylation is inhibited through internalization of the signalosome complex, resulting in the sequestration of GSK3-beta into multi-vesicular bodies. No longer phosphorylated and targeted for degradation, beta-catenin is free to enter the nucleus and modulate downstream transcription.
