NeST	Cluster1-21	Cluster1-21	AURKA CKAP5 TACC1 TACC2 YEATS4	AURKA CKAP5 TACC1 TACC2 YEATS4	5	Mitotic Spindle Assembly and Chromosome Segregation	"1. AURKA, Aurora kinase A, is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in mitotic spindle assembly, centrosome separation and maturation, and chromosome segregation. It is activated by binding to TPX2 and is involved in the regulation of the timing of mitotic events.

2. CKAP5, also known as cytoskeleton-associated protein 5 or ch-TOG, is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and is involved in spindle fiber dynamics. It interacts with TACC proteins to contribute to the stabilization of spindle microtubules.

3. TACC1 and TACC2 (transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein 1 and 2) are members of the TACC family, which are known to play roles in stabilizing microtubules and are involved in the regulation of mitotic progression. They interact with CKAP5 and contribute to the proper assembly of the mitotic spindle.

4. YEATS4, also known as GAS41, is a component of the chromatin-modifying complexes and has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and cell cycle progression. While its direct role in spindle assembly is less clear, it may influence mitotic events through chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

In summary, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of mitosis, specifically in the assembly and stabilization of the mitotic spindle and the accurate segregation of chromosomes. AURKA acts as a key regulator, while CKAP5, TACC1, and TACC2 form a complex that directly stabilizes microtubules. YEATS4, although not directly involved in spindle mechanics, may indirectly influence mitotic progression through its role in chromatin organization. The interplay between these proteins ensures the fidelity of cell division, a critical process for cell proliferation and tissue growth."	0.92	mitotic spindle organization	GO:0007052	2.799016787346556e-06	4	133	5	AURKA,CKAP5,TACC1,TACC2	0.0298507462686567	0.8	AURKA CKAP5 TACC1 TACC2	4.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Mitotic Spindle Assembly and Chromosome Segregation"" as most genes are directly involved in mitotic spindle assembly, stabilization, and chromosome segregation.

The proteins ABHD13, APLF, APTX, CHD1L, GADD45G, H2AFY, H2AFY2, HPF1, LIG4, MACROD1, NHEJ1, NSUN6, PARP3, PGBD4, PURB, TTC5, XPC, and XRCC4 are involved in various aspects of DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. These proteins function in detecting DNA damage, signaling its presence, and facilitating repair through multiple pathways, including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and non-homologous end joining.

2. LIG4, XRCC4, and NHEJ1 are key components of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. LIG4 is a ligase that, together with XRCC4, seals the DNA ends, while NHEJ1 (also known as XLF) stabilizes the DNA ends for processing.

3. APTX, GADD45G, and PARP3 are associated with base excision repair (BER). APTX resolves DNA single-strand breaks, a common type of damage. GADD45G is involved in the recognition and signaling of DNA damage, while PARP3 is implicated in DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic stability.

4. XPC is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), recognizing and initiating the repair of helix-distorting DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV light.

5. CHD1L, H2AFY, and H2AFY2 are chromatin remodelers or histone variants that modulate the accessibility of DNA to repair proteins. CHD1L has ATPase activity and is implicated in the relaxation of chromatin structure during DNA repair.

6. Proteins such as CETN2 and HAP1, while not directly involved in DNA repair, may influence the process through their roles in cell cycle regulation and intracellular trafficking, respectively.

7. The proteins PURB and EHF are transcription factors that could potentially regulate the expression of genes involved in DNA repair or the cellular response to DNA damage.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into the cellular mechanisms for maintaining genomic integrity. They work in concert to detect, signal, and repair various types of DNA damage, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and preventing the accumulation of mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer. The system reflects a robust network of proteins that orchestrate the DNA damage response and repair processes, which are critical for cellular survival and the prevention of genomic instability."	0.92	DNA repair	GO:0006281	1.0316003341333993e-12	13	604	21	APLF,APTX,ATP23,CETN2,CHD1L,MACROH2A1,HPF1,LIG4,NHEJ1,PARP3,TTC5,XPC,XRCC4	0.0212418300653594	0.6190476190476191	APTX CHD1L GADD45G H2AFY H2AFY2 LIG4 NHEJ1 PARP3 XPC XRCC4	10.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are directly involved in various aspects of the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms, including detection, signaling, and repair of DNA damage through multiple pathways.

ACAA1 (Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1) and ACOX1 (Acyl-CoA oxidase 1) are key enzymes in the beta-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids within peroxisomes. ACAA1 catalyzes the last step of the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, while ACOX1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step.

2. C6orf226 is a less characterized protein, but its association with peroxisomal proteins suggests a role in peroxisomal function or biogenesis.

3. CAT (Catalase) is a peroxisomal marker enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of fatty acid beta-oxidation, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage.

4. DDO (D-aspartate oxidase) and DECR2 (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 2) are involved in the catabolism of D-amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids, respectively, processes that occur within peroxisomes.

5. HSD17B4 (Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4) is a multifunctional enzyme that also participates in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation.

6. PEX5L (Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5-like), PEX6, PEX16, and PEX26 are all members of the peroxins family, which are proteins involved in the biogenesis and maintenance of peroxisomes. PEX5L is a variant of PEX5 and is involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. PEX6, PEX16, and PEX26 are involved in the assembly of the peroxisomal membrane and the import of matrix proteins.

7. PSMB1 (Proteasome subunit beta type-1) is a component of the proteasome, which is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. While not a peroxisomal protein, its presence in the system may be related to the degradation of misfolded or unnecessary peroxisomal proteins.

8. SLC25A17 (Solute carrier family 25 member 17) is a peroxisomal membrane protein that functions as a transporter, potentially involved in the import of cofactors or export of metabolites.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in peroxisomal functions, including fatty acid metabolism, detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, and catabolism of D-amino acids. The presence of multiple peroxins indicates a strong emphasis on peroxisomal biogenesis and maintenance. The inclusion of PSMB1 suggests a link to protein quality control mechanisms, possibly related to peroxisomal dynamics. The system reflects a coordinated network of proteins that maintain peroxisomal integrity and metabolic functions."	0.94	peroxisome organization	GO:0007031	5.127465749420131e-09	5	39	12	ACOX1,PEX5L,PEX6,PEX16,PEX26	0.108695652173913	0.4166666666666667	ACAA1 ACOX1 CAT HSD17B4 PEX5L PEX6 PEX16 PEX26 SLC25A17	9.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are directly involved in peroxisomal functions, including fatty acid metabolism, detoxification, and biogenesis.

LYST, or lysosomal trafficking regulator, is involved in the regulation of lysosomal size and morphology. It plays a role in the sorting and trafficking of endosomal cargo destined for lysosomes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organelle function.

2. NRDE2 is less characterized but is thought to be involved in nuclear RNAi and may play a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, potentially influencing the stability or localization of specific mRNA transcripts.

3. REN, also known as renin, is primarily involved in blood pressure control and electrolyte balance. It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is not directly related to endosomal sorting but may be affected by vesicular trafficking processes.

4. SNRPA1 is a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein that is part of the spliceosome complex. It is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a process that occurs in the nucleus and is not directly related to endosomal sorting.

5. SNX6, SNX7, and SNX12 are members of the sorting nexin family. These proteins are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, playing roles in the retromer complex, which is responsible for the retrograde transport of cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.

6. SORT1, or sortilin, functions in the sorting of proteins to the lysosomes. It is involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes and may also play a role in neurotrophic signaling and apoptosis.

7. TMEM9, TMEM123, and TMEM189 are transmembrane proteins with less well-characterized functions. However, transmembrane proteins often play roles in cellular transport and signaling, potentially contributing to the trafficking system.

8. WASHC3 is part of the WASH complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting and the regulation of actin polymerization. It plays a role in the fission of transport intermediates from the endosomes.

9. WDFY1 is a WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein that is implicated in endosomal sorting and signaling pathways, potentially acting as an adaptor in the endosomal system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in the processes of endosomal sorting and trafficking, which are essential for the proper distribution and degradation of cellular components. While not all proteins are directly linked to this process, the preponderance of sorting nexins and related proteins suggests a strong functional theme. The presence of proteins like REN and SNRPA1, which are not directly related to endosomal sorting, slightly lowers the confidence score. However, the overall function of the system appears to be centered on the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and the regulation of cargo sorting and trafficking within the cell."	0.85	endosomal transport	GO:0016197	3.35040078470048e-06	6	286	12	LYST,SNX6,SNX7,SNX12,SORT1,WASHC3	0.0205479452054794	0.5	LYST SNX6 SNX7 SNX12 SORT1 WASHC3 WDFY1	7.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, as indicated by definite assertions in the text.

MAGEL2 is a member of the MAGE family and is involved in intracellular trafficking and neurodevelopment. It has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy and endosomal sorting, particularly in neurons. Mutations in MAGEL2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting its critical role in these processes.

2. SNX5, SNX6, and SNX7 are part of the sorting nexin family. These proteins are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking. They play roles in the retromer complex, which is essential for the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. SNX5 and SNX6 have been shown to form a subcomplex that is implicated in the sorting of transmembrane proteins.

3. WASHC3 is a component of the WASH complex, which is involved in the actin-dependent process of endosomal sorting. It plays a role in the fission of tubules that serve as transport intermediates. The WASH complex is critical for the sorting of endosomal cargo and the recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane.

4. WDFY1 is a FYVE domain-containing protein that has been implicated in endosomal trafficking. It is involved in the early stages of autophagosome formation and may act as an adaptor protein that recruits other proteins to the endosome.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the processes of endosomal sorting and trafficking. They contribute to the proper distribution and recycling of cellular components, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental cues. The involvement of these proteins in the retromer complex and the WASH complex highlights their integrated roles in the endosomal system. The presence of MAGEL2 also suggests a specific importance in neuronal cells, potentially linking endosomal trafficking to neurodevelopmental processes."	0.91	endosomal transport	GO:0016197	9.115597874848778e-07	5	286	6	MAGEL2,SNX5,SNX6,SNX7,WASHC3	0.0174216027874564	0.8333333333333334	MAGEL2 SNX5 SNX6 SNX7 WASHC3 WDFY1	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Endosomal Sorting and Trafficking"" as all listed genes are definitively involved in endosomal sorting, trafficking, and related processes.

Cilia play essential roles in motility, sensory perception, and signal transduction. The majority of the proteins mentioned contain coiled-coil domains (CCDC), tetratricopeptide repeats (TTC), or are otherwise implicated in ciliary structure and function.

1. Proteins such as DNAH2, DNAH10, DNAL1, and DNALI1 are dynein heavy and light intermediate chains, which are motor proteins that drive the bending motion of cilia and flagella. Their coordinated activity is crucial for ciliary motility.

2. CCDC proteins, including CCDC30, CCDC74A, CCDC74B, and CCDC103, are often involved in the assembly, maintenance, and function of cilia. CCDC proteins can contribute to the structural integrity of the axoneme, the central shaft of a cilium, or play roles in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system that is essential for ciliogenesis and the movement of molecules along the ciliary length.

3. Proteins such as CFAP43, CFAP45, and CFAP52 are cilia- and flagella-associated proteins that are implicated in the proper formation and function of cilia. Mutations in these proteins can lead to ciliary defects and related disorders.

4. NPHP1, TMEM67 (also known as Meckelin), and TCTN2 are proteins associated with the ciliopathy nephronophthisis and Joubert syndrome, respectively. These proteins are involved in the signaling pathways and structural integrity of cilia.

5. Proteins like RSPH10B2 and RSPH14 are radial spoke head proteins, which are components of the radial spokes that regulate the movement of cilia and flagella.

6. TTC proteins such as TTC16 and TTC23L are characterized by tetratricopeptide repeat domains, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. These proteins may be involved in the assembly and function of ciliary components.

7. Proteins like SPEF2 and SPATA17 are implicated in sperm flagella function, which is a specialized type of cilium critical for male fertility.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the formation (ciliogenesis) and function of cilia. They contribute to the structural integrity of the ciliary axoneme, the assembly of ciliary components, the motility of cilia and flagella, and the signaling pathways associated with ciliary function. Given the high proportion of genes in the system that participate in these processes, the name ""Ciliogenesis and Ciliary Function"" is proposed with high confidence."	0.92	cilium movement	GO:0003341	8.963788345693311e-34	26	209	61	CATIP,CCDC74A,CCDC157,CCDC181,CFAP119,CCDC191,CDHR4,CFAP43,CFAP45,CFAP52,CFAP61,CFAP69,CFAP70,CFAP161,DNAH2,DNAL1,DNAAF4,FAM227A,LDLRAD1,LRRC71,LRTOMT,RAB36,RSPH14,SAMD15,SPACA9,TOGARAM2	0.1065573770491803	0.4262295081967213	DNAH2 DNAH10 DNAL1 DNALI1 CCDC30 CCDC74A CCDC74B CCDC103 CFAP43 CFAP45 CFAP52 NPHP1 TMEM67 TCTN2 RSPH10B2 RSPH14 TTC16 TTC23L SPEF2 SPATA17	20.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Ciliogenesis and Ciliary Function"" because they are explicitly described as being involved in the formation, maintenance, and function of cilia.

The proteins APC2, CELSR1, CELSR2, CELSR3, FAT4, FREM2, FUZ, FZD1-10, INTU, NUMBL, PRICKLE1, PRICKLE3, RSG1, and VANGL1 are integral components of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for the establishment of cellular orientation within the plane of a tissue, which is orthogonal to the direction of the apical-basal axis.

2. The Frizzled family proteins (FZD1-10) are seven-pass transmembrane receptors that bind Wnt ligands and initiate PCP signaling. They work in concert with co-receptors such as VANGL1 and members of the CELSR family to transduce signals that regulate cytoskeletal organization and cell polarity.

3. The Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) proteins, represented by INTU in this system, are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and are activated downstream of Frizzled receptors.

4. Proteins such as PRICKLE1 and PRICKLE3 are post-synaptic density proteins that interact with other PCP components to modulate their activity and stabilize asymmetric cell complexes, which are essential for the directional cell behaviors.

5. APC2 is a component of the destruction complex that regulates the levels of β-catenin, a key effector in canonical Wnt signaling, which is also known to intersect with PCP signaling.

6. FAT4 and FREM2 are atypical cadherins and extracellular matrix proteins, respectively, that are implicated in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, which are influenced by PCP signaling.

7. NUMBL is a Notch signaling inhibitor that can interact with components of the Wnt/PCP pathway, suggesting a potential cross-talk between these two pathways.

8. FUZ is a planar cell polarity effector that has been implicated in ciliogenesis and is necessary for the proper orientation of cilia in response to PCP signals.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity signaling pathway, which is essential for the coordinated orientation of cells across the plane of a tissue.

Several proteins in this system, such as FADS1, FASN, HMGCS1, INSIG1, LDLR, LSS, MSMO1, SCD, and SQLE, are directly involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis. FADS1 is involved in the desaturation of fatty acids, a critical step in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. FASN is a key enzyme in de novo lipogenesis, catalyzing the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. HMGCS1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis.

2. INSIG1 is a regulatory protein that mediates feedback control of cholesterol synthesis by binding to sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). LDLR is a receptor that mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. LSS, MSMO1, and SQLE are all enzymes involved in the multi-step process of cholesterol synthesis, with SQLE being a rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway.

3. SCD is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are important components of membrane phospholipids and also serve as lipid signaling molecules.

4. Other proteins in the system, such as CYP1B1 and SERPING1, have roles that are tangentially related to lipid metabolism. CYP1B1 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of various lipophilic compounds, and SERPING1 is a serine protease inhibitor that can influence inflammation and vascular function, processes that are affected by lipid metabolism.

These range from protein synthesis (RPL37A, RPL38), stress response (HSPA6), apoptosis (CASP1), cell cycle regulation (CDKN2A), to signal transduction (RGS1, RGS2) and neurotransmission (NPY1R). While these proteins have important roles in cellular function, they do not directly contribute to the central process of lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis, with a significant number of proteins directly participating in these pathways. However, the presence of proteins with diverse and unrelated functions suggests that this system also engages in other cellular processes, which is reflected in the confidence score."	0.85	sterol metabolic process	GO:0016125	1.5000683585228085e-06	7	152	28	1060P11.3,FASN,HSPA6,INSIG1,LDLR,LSS,SERPING1	0.0404624277456647	0.25	FADS1 FASN HMGCS1 INSIG1 LDLR LSS MSMO1 SCD SQLE	9.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Lipid Metabolism and Cholesterol Biosynthesis"" as several genes are directly involved in these processes.

Several proteins in this system are directly involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1) is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase) catalyzes the final step in cholesterol synthesis. FDFT1 (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1) is responsible for the first committed step in cholesterol production, the synthesis of squalene from farnesyl diphosphate.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) plays a regulatory role in cholesterol synthesis. It binds to sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and retains them in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing their processing and subsequent activation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the uptake of cholesterol from the bloodstream, providing feedback regulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis.

3. FASN (fatty acid synthase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of fatty acids, a process closely related to the production of cholesterol, as both pathways share precursors and regulatory mechanisms.

4. Several other proteins in the system, such as DDX17 (DEAD-box helicase 17) and KDELR3 (KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 3), may not be directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis but can influence the process indirectly through their roles in RNA processing and protein trafficking, respectively.

5. The presence of NOTCH2 (Notch homolog 2) suggests a link to cellular differentiation and proliferation, which could be related to the demand for cholesterol in membrane synthesis during cell growth.

6. The system also includes proteins with more diverse functions that do not directly relate to cholesterol metabolism, such as AGTR1 (angiotensin II receptor type 1) involved in blood pressure regulation, and BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like) which is implicated in apoptosis and autophagy.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, indicating a strong emphasis on cholesterol homeostasis. The interplay between enzymes of the biosynthesis pathway, regulatory proteins, and receptors ensures tight control of cholesterol levels within cells and throughout the body. However, the presence of proteins with unrelated functions suggests that not all components of the system are dedicated to this process, which is reflected in the confidence score."	0.85	cholesterol biosynthetic process	GO:0006695	0.0028222600379124	4	54	43	DDX17,FASN,FDFT1,IGF2BP3	0.043010752688172	0.0930232558139534	HMGCS1 DHCR24 FDFT1 INSIG1 LDLR	5.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Regulation"" because they are directly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol.

Several proteins in this system are directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis. DHCR7, FDFT1, and MSMO1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. DHCR7 catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, FDFT1 is involved in the first committed step of sterol synthesis, and MSMO1 is responsible for the conversion of methylsterol intermediates to cholesterol.

2. INSIG1 and LDLR are critical in cholesterol regulation. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. LDLR is a cell-surface receptor responsible for the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is a primary mechanism for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream.

3. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fats are components of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides, and they play a role in the fluidity and function of biological membranes, which can indirectly affect cholesterol metabolism.

4. The presence of other proteins such as PXDN and CLDN10, which are involved in extracellular matrix formation and tight junctions respectively, suggests additional roles in tissue organization and integrity, which may be related to the broader context of cholesterol metabolism and its impact on cellular structures.

5. Proteins like TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2) indicate a connection to signaling pathways that can influence cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which may intersect with cholesterol metabolism in complex ways, such as in the regulation of cell growth and the synthesis of membrane components.

To summarize, the prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is centered around cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation. The system includes enzymes directly involved in the production of cholesterol, proteins that regulate its synthesis and uptake, and factors that may influence or be influenced by cholesterol metabolism in the context of cell signaling and structural integrity. The confidence score reflects that while a significant number of proteins are involved in cholesterol-related processes, there are additional proteins with functions that are not directly related to cholesterol but may be part of broader cellular contexts in which cholesterol plays a role."	0.85	cholesterol biosynthetic process	GO:0006695	0.0003506232798447	4	54	28	COL5A1,FAP,FDFT1,LDLR	0.0512820512820512	0.1428571428571428	DHCR7 FDFT1 MSMO1 INSIG1 LDLR	5.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Regulation"" because they are directly involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol.

The proteins TUBA3C, TUBA3D, TUBA3E, TUBA8, TUBB1, TUBB3, and TUBB8 are all tubulin subunits, which are the building blocks of microtubules. Microtubules are critical for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and are essential components of the mitotic spindle during cell division. These proteins are involved in the polymerization and stabilization of microtubules, affecting cellular dynamics and architecture.

2. MAPRE2 and MAPRE3, also known as EB2 and EB3, are microtubule-associated proteins that bind to the plus-end of microtubules, regulating their dynamics and interactions with other cellular components. They are involved in microtubule-based processes such as mitosis and cell migration.

3. Proteins such as STOM (stomatin) are involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and associated with membrane integrity and ion channel regulation. SCNN1G is a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel and is involved in the regulation of sodium balance and blood pressure.

4. TXNDC9, UCHL1, and ATG4B are involved in protein folding and degradation pathways. TXNDC9 is a thioredoxin domain-containing protein that may be involved in the oxidative stress response. UCHL1 is a ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1, playing a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for protein degradation. ATG4B is a cysteine protease required for autophagy, which is the process of degrading and recycling cellular components.

5. TBCA, TBCE, and TCP1 are chaperonins involved in tubulin folding and the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. These proteins assist in the correct folding of newly synthesized proteins or the refolding of misfolded proteins.

6. TNPO1, TNPO2, and TNPO3 are transportin proteins that mediate the nuclear import of specific proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. They are part of the karyopherin family and are involved in the nuclear transport cycle.

7. XPO1 (also known as CRM1) and XPO6 are involved in nuclear export. XPO1 mediates the nuclear export of a wide variety of proteins and RNAs, while XPO6 is involved in the export of specific proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

8. PFKL and PFKP are isoforms of the enzyme phosphofructokinase, which is a key regulatory enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. They are involved in the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a rate-limiting step in glycolysis.

9. SYT9 is a member of the synaptotagmin family, which are membrane-trafficking proteins that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. NECAB2 is a neuronal calcium-binding protein, which may be involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and neurodevelopment.

10. CA9 (carbonic anhydrase IX) is involved in pH regulation and is associated with the cellular response to hypoxia.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the organization, dynamics, and function of the cytoskeleton, particularly microtubules, and in the intracellular transport of proteins and other molecules. The system also includes proteins that participate in metabolic processes, ion transport, and the cellular stress response. The interplay between these proteins supports the structural integrity of cells, the transport of cellular components, and the regulation of cellular metabolism and signaling."	0.88	microtubule cytoskeleton organization	GO:0000226	1.826082727726436e-07	11	659	27	MAPRE2,MAPRE3,TNPO3,TUBA3C,TUBA3D,TUBA3E,TUBA8,TUBB1,TUBB3,TUBB8,UCHL1	0.0162962962962962	0.4074074074074074	TUBA3C TUBA3D TUBA3E TUBA8 TUBB1 TUBB3 TUBB8 MAPRE2 MAPRE3 TBCA TBCE TCP1 TNPO1 TNPO2 TNPO3 XPO1 XPO6	17.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the organization, dynamics, and function of the cytoskeleton, particularly microtubules, and in the intracellular transport of proteins and other molecules.

BEGAIN, CAMSAP2, CEP170, CLASP1, and CLIP2 are proteins that interact with microtubules, which are components of the cytoskeleton. These proteins are involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules, as well as in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. CAMSAP2 anchors non-centrosomal microtubules to the cell cortex, while CLASP1 and CLIP2 regulate microtubule plus-end dynamics, influencing cell shape, polarity, and motility.

2. KIFC3 is a kinesin motor protein that moves along microtubules and is involved in intracellular transport, particularly in the transport of organelles and vesicles. It plays a role in the distribution of mitochondria and lysosomes within cells.

3. MARCKS is a protein that binds to actin filaments and is implicated in the cross-talk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. It is involved in cell motility, adhesion, and the formation of cellular protrusions.

4. NOP10 is a component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is involved in the processing and modification of rRNA. Although not directly related to cytoskeletal organization or intracellular transport, its interaction with the other proteins could be related to the localization of snoRNP complexes within the cell.

5. NT5C is a 5'-nucleotidase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular nucleotide levels and can indirectly affect various cellular processes, including signaling pathways that may influence cytoskeletal dynamics.

6. TRPV1 is a non-selective cation channel that responds to heat and inflammatory signals. It is primarily known for its role in sensory neurons but can also be expressed in non-neuronal tissues. Its interaction with the cytoskeletal proteins could be related to the regulation of cellular responses to stress or changes in the environment.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the organization, stabilization, and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, as well as in the intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles. The interactions between these proteins suggest a coordinated network that ensures proper cellular architecture and distribution of cellular components. While NOP10 and NT5C are not directly related to these processes, their inclusion in the system may reflect regulatory or localization roles that are yet to be fully understood. TRPV1's role in this context is less clear but may involve cellular stress responses that impact cytoskeletal dynamics."	0.85	cytoplasmic microtubule organization	GO:0031122	0.0011980331805086	3	60	9	CAMSAP2,CLASP1,CLIP2	0.0454545454545454	0.3333333333333333	BEGAIN CAMSAP2 CEP170 CLASP1 CLIP2 KIFC3	6.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the organization, stabilization, and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, as well as intracellular transport.

ARSA (arylsulfatase A), ARSB (arylsulfatase B), GUSB (beta-glucuronidase), NAGLU (alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase), SGSH (N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase), and SUMF2 (sulfatase modifying factor 2) are enzymes involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These enzymes sequentially degrade GAGs, which are complex carbohydrates attached to proteins to form proteoglycans, a major component of the extracellular matrix.

2. GALNS (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase) and CHST10 (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 10) are also involved in the modification and degradation of GAGs. GALNS specifically hydrolyzes the sulfate ester bonds of keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, while CHST10 transfers sulfate groups to position 3 of the glucosamine residue of heparan sulfate.

3. CHPF (chondroitin polymerizing factor) and CHPF2 (chondroitin polymerizing factor 2) are involved in the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate, another type of GAG, by polymerizing the glycosaminoglycan chain.

4. GALNT18 (polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18) is involved in the initial steps of mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation, which can affect the stability and function of proteins, including those involved in GAG metabolism.

5. SIAE (sialic acid acetylesterase) is involved in the regulation of sialylated glycoconjugates, which can include proteoglycans.

6. PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein) is involved in lipid metabolism and may indirectly influence the lipid environment of GAGs and proteoglycans.

7. The proteins PLXNA1 (plexin A1), PLXNA3 (plexin A3), SEMA4F (semaphorin 4F), and MEGF8 (multiple EGF-like-domains 8) are involved in cell signaling and may interact with proteoglycans or GAGs as part of their signaling pathways.

8. MOXD1 (monooxygenase DBH-like 1) and PAM (peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase) are involved in peptide modification and neurotransmitter synthesis, which may be indirectly related to GAG metabolism or signaling.

9. IL17RA (interleukin 17 receptor A) is a cytokine receptor that mediates inflammatory responses and may interact with GAGs in the immune system.

10. CERCAM (cell adhesion molecule) and CHID1 (chitinase domain containing 1) are involved in cell adhesion and immune responses, potentially interacting with the extracellular matrix and GAGs.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the metabolism, modification, and signaling of glycosaminoglycans. These processes are critical for the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and for various cellular functions, including cell adhesion, signaling, and immune responses. The system reflects a functional integration centered on GAG metabolism and sulfation, with additional roles in cell signaling and immune modulation."	0.88	proteoglycan metabolic process	GO:0006029	1.6353459708907616e-07	6	91	20	CHPF,CHPF2,CHST10,GUSB,NAGLU,SGSH	0.0571428571428571	0.3	ARSA ARSB GUSB NAGLU SGSH SUMF2 GALNS CHST10 CHPF CHPF2	10.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the metabolism, modification, and signaling of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which supports the suggested name ""Glycosaminoglycan Metabolism and Sulfation.""

BYSL, also known as Bystin, is involved in cell adhesion and, importantly, in pre-ribosomal RNA processing, which is a crucial step in ribosome biogenesis. It is part of a complex with nucleolar proteins that are essential for ribosome assembly and transport.

2. CSNK1G3, a member of the casein kinase 1 family, is known to play a role in various cellular processes, including Wnt signaling and circadian rhythms. However, it also has been implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis through phosphorylation of translation factors and ribosomal proteins, which can affect ribosome function and the initiation of translation.

3. DIMT1 is an essential methyltransferase that specifically dimethylates adenine in 18S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit. This modification is a critical step in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is necessary for the proper functioning of the ribosome during protein synthesis.

4. RPS5 and RPS13 are both components of the 40S ribosomal subunit. RPS5 is involved in the binding of tRNA and mRNA during translation, while RPS13 is important for maintaining the structure of the ribosome and ensuring accurate translation.

5. RRP12 is a ribosomal RNA processing protein that is involved in the late stages of pre-60S ribosomal subunit maturation. It is essential for the export of the 60S subunit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it can engage in protein synthesis.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the production and function of ribosomes, the cellular machines responsible for protein synthesis. The system includes proteins that participate in the maturation of ribosomal RNA, assembly of ribosomal subunits, and regulation of the translation process. The interplay between these proteins ensures the fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis, which is fundamental to all cellular processes."	0.92	ribosomal small subunit biogenesis	GO:0042274	6.117313016523708e-07	4	101	6	BYSL,DIMT1,RPS5,RPS13	0.0388349514563106	0.6666666666666666	BYSL DIMT1 RPS5 RPS13 RRP12	5.0	-- Summary --||The provided text describes the roles of the genes in the context of ribosome biogenesis and protein translation regulation.

Several proteins in this system, such as ATF3, DDIT4, HMOX1, and NUPR1, are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. ATF3 is a transcription factor that is rapidly induced by various stress signals. DDIT4 is a modulator of the mTOR pathway, which is a key regulator of cell growth and stress response. HMOX1 encodes heme oxygenase 1, which is involved in the degradation of heme and has a protective role in oxidative stress. NUPR1 is a stress-induced protein that plays a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

2. Proteins like CCND2, ID4, IGFBP5, and PDGFRA are associated with cell cycle regulation and growth. CCND2 is a cyclin that drives cells through the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. ID4 acts as a regulator of cell growth by inhibiting differentiation and maintaining cells in a proliferative state. IGFBP5 is involved in the regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) activity, which is critical for cell growth and development. PDGFRA is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the platelet-derived growth factor family, and it plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.

3. The presence of histone proteins HIST1H1C, HIST1H2AC, and HIST1H2BD suggests involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, which are processes that can be linked to stress response and tumor suppression through the regulation of gene expression.

4. Tumor suppressive functions are also indicated by proteins such as ANXA1, which has anti-inflammatory properties and a potential role in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. SERPINA3 is a serine protease inhibitor that can influence apoptosis, and PROS1 (Protein S) is known to have anticoagulant and cytoprotective activities.

5. The system includes proteins like VEGFA, which is a major regulator of angiogenesis, and FN1, which encodes fibronectin, a glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and migration processes. These proteins are crucial in the context of tumor growth and metastasis.

6. Stress granule-associated proteins such as TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA1) and G3BP stress granule assembly factor 1 (G3BP1) are not explicitly listed, but their involvement in stress response pathways could be inferred through the presence of other stress-related proteins.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response mechanisms and tumor suppressive activities. They participate in the regulation of cell cycle, response to oxidative stress, chromatin remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation. The system reflects a multifaceted response to cellular stress that can contribute to the suppression of tumorigenesis."	0.85	response to stress	GO:0006950	2.7315394281197606e-06	39	3855	81	1060P11.3,ANXA1,ASNS,CCND2,CFD,CWC25,DDIT4,FCGBP,H2BC5,LASP1,LMO4,MARS1,NFIL3,NID2,OLFM4,PCGF2,PCK2,PROM1,PSMB3,SDC2,SGCE,TPD52,UBQLN2,UFM1,ATP6V0E2,BCL6,CYFIP2,ENPP2,GAL,GATA3,KRT5,LGALS3BP,P4HTM,PPIG,PRDX2,PXDN,SFN,SPRR1A,TFPI2	0.0100076982294072	0.4814814814814814	ATF3 DDIT4 HMOX1 NUPR1 CCND2 ID4 IGFBP5 PDGFRA HIST1H1C HIST1H2AC HIST1H2BD ANXA1 SERPINA3 PROS1 VEGFA FN1	16.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Tumor Suppression"" due to their involvement in cellular stress responses, cell cycle regulation, chromatin remodeling, and tumor suppressive activities.

The KRTAP (Keratin Associated Protein) family members, including KRTAP2-4, KRTAP4-4, KRTAP4-11, KRTAP5-3, KRTAP5-6, KRTAP9-8, KRTAP10-3, and KRTAP10-7, are a group of proteins that are associated with the keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. They contribute to the formation of the hair shaft by determining its shape and rigidity. These proteins are rich in cysteine, which allows for the formation of disulfide bonds, leading to the highly cross-linked and resilient structure of hair keratin.

2. The LCE (Late Cornified Envelope) proteins, including LCE3A, LCE3B, LCE3C, and LCE4A, are expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis. They are involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a structure that provides a barrier to protect against environmental stressors, pathogens, and water loss. The LCE proteins are thought to play a role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which is a critical process in maintaining skin integrity and function.

3. SSC4D (Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen Recognized by T Cells 4D) is less directly related to the structural components of hair and skin but may be involved in immune responses in the skin. It is a serine protease inhibitor that can be overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting a role in the regulation of protease activity during skin pathology.

To summarize, the majority of the genes in this set encode proteins that are directly involved in the structural integrity and formation of hair and the epidermal barrier. They play crucial roles in keratinocyte differentiation and the establishment of the physical and protective properties of the skin and hair. The presence of SSC4D suggests a potential link to skin immune responses or pathology, but its role is less central to the primary process identified. The high confidence score reflects the strong thematic consistency among the KRTAP and LCE proteins in their contribution to keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal barrier formation."	0.92	keratinization	GO:0031424	7.0829488251594766e-09	4	82	4	LCE3A,LCE3B,LCE3C,LCE4A	0.048780487804878	1.0	KRTAP2-4 KRTAP4-4 KRTAP4-11 KRTAP5-3 KRTAP5-6 KRTAP9-8 KRTAP10-3 KRTAP10-7 LCE3A LCE3B LCE3C LCE4A	12.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in keratinocyte differentiation and the formation of the epidermal barrier, as indicated by their roles in hair shaft formation and the cornified envelope.

BBS9 and BBS10 are part of the BBSome complex, which is involved in the structure and function of cilia, cellular organelles that play a critical role in various signaling pathways and sensory functions. Mutations in these proteins are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction leading to retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, and kidney abnormalities.

2. LZTFL1 and MKKS (also known as BBS6) are also associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome and ciliary function. LZTFL1 is thought to regulate the BBSome complex's ciliary trafficking, while MKKS has a dual role in both ciliogenesis and the cell cycle regulation.

3. TTC8 (also known as BBS8) is another component of the BBSome complex, contributing to the structure and function of cilia. Like BBS9 and BBS10, mutations in TTC8 can lead to Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

4. PSMA5 is a component of the proteasome, a complex responsible for protein degradation, which is essential for many cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and signal transduction. While not directly related to ciliary function, proteasomal activity can influence the turnover of ciliary components and thus indirectly affect ciliary function.

5. RNF19A is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which tags proteins with ubiquitin for degradation by the proteasome. It may have a role in the regulation of proteins involved in ciliary function through targeted degradation.

6. DPP3 is a dipeptidyl-peptidase that cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of protein substrates. It is not directly linked to ciliary function but could be involved in the processing of signaling molecules that participate in ciliary signaling pathways.

To summarize, the majority of the genes in this set encode proteins that are directly involved in the formation, maintenance, and function of cilia, with a strong association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy. The presence of proteins involved in protein degradation suggests a regulatory mechanism for controlling the turnover of ciliary components.

The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a cellular defense mechanism activated by various stress conditions, including amino acid deprivation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Proteins such as ATF3, ATF4, DDIT3 (also known as CHOP), and GADD45A are key transcription factors and downstream effectors in the ISR. They regulate gene expression to restore cellular homeostasis or induce apoptosis if the stress is too severe.

2. ER-associated proteins like DNAJC10 (ERdj5), DNAJC3 (P58IPK), EDEM1, HERPUD1, HSPA5 (BiP/GRP78), and SERP1 are involved in protein folding and the unfolded protein response (UPR), a subset of the ISR. These proteins help to alleviate ER stress by enhancing the degradation of misfolded proteins and improving the protein folding capacity of the ER.

3. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as CARS, GARS, IARS, and WARS are essential for protein synthesis, linking amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs. Under stress conditions, they can have non-canonical functions, including signaling roles in the ISR.

4. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of proteins that provides structural support to cells and tissues. COL1A1 and COL4A5 are collagen proteins that contribute to the ECM's integrity. LAMB1 is a laminin, crucial for basement membrane assembly. THBS2 and CHI3L1 are involved in ECM remodeling and cell-matrix interactions.

5. Proteins like HMGCR and HMGCS1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis, which is tightly regulated by cellular stress and energy status. LDLR is involved in cholesterol uptake, and SCD is a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis, indicating a link between stress response and lipid metabolism.

6. Several proteins in the system, such as ASS1, ASNS, PSAT1, and GFPT1, are involved in amino acid metabolism and the cellular response to amino acid availability, which is closely related to the ISR.

7. MYC is a well-known oncogene and transcription factor that regulates various cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. Its activity can be influenced by stress responses and nutrient availability.

8. The presence of proteins like CD163, CFH, and VSIG4, which are involved in immune responses and inflammation, suggests a connection between stress responses and immune modulation.

Several proteins in this system, such as ADH1B, CD48, FCER1A, IGHM, IGJ, IGKV4-1, IGLV2-23, MX1, S100A9, and TNFSF10, are directly involved in the immune response. ADH1B, while primarily known for its role in alcohol metabolism, also has a role in the immune system. CD48 is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in the activation and proliferation of T and B cells. FCER1A is the high-affinity IgE receptor that plays a central role in allergic disease. IGHM, IGJ, IGKV4-1, and IGLV2-23 are immunoglobulin components, essential for antibody-mediated immunity. MX1 is an interferon-induced GTPase that has antiviral activity. S100A9 is a calcium-binding protein with a role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immune response. TNFSF10, also known as TRAIL, is a cytokine that induces apoptosis in tumor cells and participates in immune surveillance.

2. Proteins such as CHI3L1, FGL2, IFI44L, RGS2, and SRGN are associated with inflammation and immune regulation. CHI3L1 is involved in tissue remodeling and is upregulated in various inflammatory conditions. FGL2 has prothrombinase activity and is implicated in the regulation of macrophage response. IFI44L is an interferon-induced protein that may play a role in antiviral defense. RGS2 can regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling, which is important in various immune responses. SRGN is a proteoglycan found in the extracellular matrix and granules of various cells, including immune cells, and is involved in modulating cell adhesion and proliferation.

3. The presence of proteins like AGR2, ALCAM, CRISPLD2, EPCAM, and VTCN1 suggests a role in cell adhesion, migration, and immune interactions. AGR2 is involved in protein folding and also plays a role in immune system processes. ALCAM is a cell adhesion molecule that is important in the immune response and in the interaction between T cells and dendritic cells. EPCAM is a carcinoma-associated antigen and is involved in cell signaling, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. VTCN1, also known as B7-H4, is an immune checkpoint molecule that negatively regulates T-cell-mediated immune response.

4. Other proteins such as ENPP1, GPR64, HSPB8, MAP4K4, NOLC1, PAN2, PDCD4, RFX5, SLC27A2, SLC37A4, and SLCO1B3 are involved in various cellular processes that can intersect with immune function. For example, ENPP1 is involved in purinergic signaling and can modulate inflammation. RFX5 is a transcription factor that regulates MHC class II genes, which are critical for antigen presentation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the immune response, with a focus on inflammation, cell adhesion, and signaling pathways that regulate immune cell activity. The system reflects a complex interplay of proteins that contribute to the body's defense mechanisms against pathogens and the regulation of immune homeostasis."	0.85	response to stimulus	GO:0050896	0.0010156646483904	35	8976	44	ADH1B,CD48,CHI3L1,FCER1A,FRY,GPR37,GRB7,GUSBP11,HOPX,IFI44L,IGHM,JCHAIN,IGKV4-1,LPAR6,LYPD3,MX1,RCBTB2,RGCC,RGS2,S100A9,SCGB1D2,SCGB2A2,SHC1,SRGN,TNFSF10,TRD,TRDV3,AGR2,ALCAM,CRISPLD2,ENPP1,EPCAM,MAP4K4,PDCD4,RFX5	0.0038953811908736	0.7954545454545454	ADH1B CD48 FCER1A IGHM IGJ IGKV4-1 IGLV2-23 MX1 S100A9 TNFSF10 CHI3L1 FGL2 IFI44L RGS2 SRGN AGR2 ALCAM EPCAM VTCN1 ENPP1 RFX5	21.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Immune Response and Inflammation"" due to their direct involvement in immune system processes, including immune cell activation, antibody-mediated immunity, antiviral activity, and regulation of inflammatory responses.

DDX23, also known as PRP28, is an RNA helicase involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. It is a component of the U5 snRNP complex and plays a role in the catalytic step II of the splicing process. DDX23 unwinds RNA duplexes, which is essential for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA.

2. SF3A1, SF3A2, and SF3B2 are components of the splicing factor 3a and 3b complexes, respectively, which are subcomplexes of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). These proteins are critical for the assembly of the spliceosome, the large RNA-protein molecular complex that facilitates the removal of introns from pre-mRNA.

3. SNW1, also known as SKIP, is a splicing coactivator that interacts with the spliceosome and is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. It associates with both the core spliceosome and the U1 snRNP, influencing the recognition of splice sites and modulating the splicing process.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are integral to the pre-mRNA splicing process. They work in concert to ensure the accurate and efficient removal of introns from pre-mRNA, which is essential for the generation of mature and translatable mRNA molecules. The proteins are involved in various stages of spliceosome assembly and function, from the recognition of splice sites to the catalysis of splicing reactions. Their interactions are crucial for the regulation of alternative splicing, which allows for the production of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene, thereby contributing to the complexity of the proteome."	0.95	U2-type prespliceosome assembly	GO:1903241	2.9855792908958986e-06	3	24	5	SF3A1,SF3A2,SF3B2	0.1153846153846153	0.6	DDX23 SF3A1 SF3A2 SF3B2 SNW1	5.0	"-- Summary --||The provided text describes the roles of DDX23, SF3A1, SF3A2, SF3B2, and SNW1 in the pre-mRNA splicing process.

BID is a BH3-interacting domain death agonist. Upon activation by caspase-8, it translocates to mitochondria and promotes the release of cytochrome c (CYCS), leading to the activation of downstream caspases. It serves as a molecular link between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis.

2. CASP1, or caspase-1, is an enzyme that plays a role in the inflammatory response and pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis. It is involved in the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although not directly apoptotic, it can influence apoptotic processes through cross-talk with other signaling pathways.

3. CYCS, cytochrome c, released from the mitochondria upon apoptotic stimuli, is a critical component of the apoptosome, a complex that activates caspase-9, leading to the activation of the caspase cascade and cell death.

4. DAXX is a multifunctional protein involved in apoptosis, transcription, and chromatin remodeling. It can enhance apoptosis by interacting with apoptosis-regulating proteins such as ASK1 and JNK.

5. MAP2K4, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, is involved in the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway. It phosphorylates and activates MAPK8, which is implicated in the transduction of apoptotic signals.

6. MAPK1, also known as ERK2, is part of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. It can play a role in the induction of apoptosis depending on the cellular context and the strength and duration of its activation.

7. MAPK8, or JNK1, is activated by various cell stresses and inflammatory cytokines. It promotes apoptosis by phosphorylating and modulating the activity of several transcription factors, and proteins like BIM and BID.

8. PSME3, also known as PA28-gamma, is a proteasome activator that has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle. It can influence the degradation of various proteins involved in apoptotic pathways.

9. SIRT1 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that modulates processes such as apoptosis and stress resistance. It can deacetylate and affect the activity of several proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway, including p53.

10. XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, is a potent inhibitor of the caspase cascade. It binds to and inhibits caspases -3, -7, and -9, thereby suppressing apoptosis.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation and execution of apoptosis.

AKAP13, also known as A-kinase anchor protein 13, is a scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of multiprotein complexes. It is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including those mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). AKAP13 anchors PKA to specific subcellular locations, facilitating localized signal transduction and ensuring that the kinase is in proximity to its substrates.

2. KSR1, or Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1, functions as a scaffold protein that facilitates the assembly of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase module, a key signaling pathway involved in cell growth and differentiation. While not directly involved in cAMP signaling, KSR1 interacts with components of the MAPK pathway, which can be modulated by cAMP levels through cross-talk between signaling pathways.

3. PRKACG represents the gamma catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. PKA is a tetrameric holoenzyme composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits and is activated upon binding to cAMP. Once activated, PKA phosphorylates a variety of substrates, leading to changes in cell function. The gamma subunit of PKA is one of the catalytic subunits that, upon cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits, is released to phosphorylate target proteins.

The proteins in this system are involved in the modulation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. AKAP13 and PRKACG are directly associated with the PKA signaling axis, with AKAP13 anchoring PKA to specific locations and PRKACG being a part of the PKA enzyme itself. KSR1, while primarily associated with the MAPK pathway, can be influenced by PKA activity, suggesting a potential for cross-talk and integration between these signaling pathways. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated regulation of cellular responses to cAMP, which is a second messenger involved in a multitude of cellular processes such as metabolism, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression."	0.89	small GTPase-mediated signal transduction	GO:0007264	0.0479041812935361	2	506	3	AKAP13,KSR1	0.0039447731755424	0.6666666666666666	AKAP13 PRKACG	2.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set ""cAMP-Dependent Signaling Modulation"" is supported by the roles of AKAP13 and PRKACG in cAMP-dependent signaling pathways.

NeST	Cluster2-146	Cluster2-146	BBC3 CC2D1A PMAIP1	BBC3 CC2D1A PMAIP1	3	Apoptotic Signaling Pathway	"1. BBC3, also known as PUMA, is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. It is involved in p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis triggered by various stimuli, including DNA damage and growth factor deprivation. BBC3 acts by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, neutralizing their protective effect and thus promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is a critical step in apoptosis.

2. PMAIP1, known as NOXA, is another pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Similar to BBC3, it is implicated in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is regulated by p53. PMAIP1 preferentially binds to MCL1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and targets it for proteasomal degradation, thereby tipping the balance towards apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

3. CC2D1A is a transcriptional co-regulator that has been implicated in neural development and is known to interact with the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A. While its direct role in apoptosis is less clear compared to BBC3 and PMAIP1, it has been associated with signaling pathways that can influence cell survival and apoptosis indirectly.

The proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. BBC3 and PMAIP1 are direct effectors of apoptosis, promoting cell death in response to stress signals. CC2D1A's role is less direct, but it may modulate apoptotic signaling through its interactions with other proteins. The majority of the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into the process of apoptosis, with a strong emphasis on the regulation of cell death through the intrinsic pathway."	0.9	positive regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway	GO:1902237	0.000242423196898	2	11	3	BBC3,PMAIP1	0.1666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	BBC3 PMAIP1	2.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Apoptotic Signaling Pathway"" as two of the three genes (BBC3 and PMAIP1) are directly involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, promoting cell death in response to stress signals.

The proteins ABL2, FRK, SRC, and YES1 are non-receptor tyrosine kinases that play crucial roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. They are involved in various cellular processes including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. These kinases can phosphorylate a variety of substrates leading to actin cytoskeletal rearrangements.

2. BLNK, NCK1, NCK2, SH3KBP1, SH3YL1, SHB, SORBS2, SORBS3, and WASL are adaptor proteins that contain SH2 and SH3 domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions that regulate signal transduction pathways. These proteins often link receptor tyrosine kinases and other membrane receptors to actin cytoskeletal rearrangements.

3. CD2AP, FNBP1, FNBP1L, and TRIP10 are involved in membrane trafficking and endocytosis. They interact with components of the actin cytoskeleton and play roles in the formation of endocytic complexes, which are essential for the internalization and recycling of membrane receptors.

4. GAS7 and WIPF3 are involved in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, which are protrusive structures that contribute to cell motility and are regulated by the actin cytoskeleton.

5. SLC2A1 and SLC2A4, also known as GLUT1 and GLUT4, are glucose transporters that facilitate the uptake of glucose across the plasma membrane. Their trafficking to and from the cell surface is regulated by insulin signaling and involves interactions with the actin cytoskeleton.

6. SMPDL3B, STAM, STAM2, and VAV2, VAV3 are involved in endosomal sorting and signaling. STAM and STAM2 are part of the ESCRT-0 complex, which is involved in the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation. VAV proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho family GTPases, which are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton.

7. SYNJ2 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that plays a role in endocytosis and the recycling of synaptic vesicles, which is also linked to actin dynamics.

8. UNC50 is involved in the Golgi-to-endosome transport and may play a role in the trafficking of proteins that are important for actin cytoskeleton regulation.

9. PEX13 is a component of the peroxisomal membrane and is involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. While not directly related to actin cytoskeleton or membrane trafficking, peroxisomes can interact with the cytoskeleton for positioning within the cell.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. These processes are essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling cell movement, and regulating the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins. The interplay between these proteins facilitates the dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton and the precise control of membrane protein localization, which is critical for cellular responsiveness to external signals."	0.92	vesicle-mediated transport	GO:0016192	7.727806293762702e-09	17	1547	32	ABL2,FNBP1,FNBP1L,RIN1,SH3KBP1,SLC2A4,SRC,SRCIN1,STAM,STAM2,SYNJ2,TRIP10,VAV2,VAV3,WASL,WIPF3,YES1	0.0108834827144686	0.53125	ABL2 FRK SRC YES1 BLNK NCK1 NCK2 SH3KBP1 SH3YL1 SHB SORBS2 SORBS3 WASL CD2AP FNBP1 FNBP1L TRIP10 GAS7 WIPF3 SLC2A1 SLC2A4 SMPDL3B STAM STAM2 VAV2 VAV3 SYNJ2 UNC50	28.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking.

GYG1 (Glycogenin-1) and GYS1 (Glycogen Synthase 1) are directly involved in glycogen synthesis. GYG1 acts as a primer for glycogen synthesis, initiating the core structure to which glucose residues are added. GYS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, responsible for the elongation of the glycogen chain by adding glucose units.

2. PPP1R3B (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3B) and PPP1R3C (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3C) are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase, thus promoting glycogen synthesis. PPP1R3B is known to be specific for the liver and PPP1R3C for skeletal muscle, indicating tissue-specific regulation of glycogen metabolism.

3. PPP1R11 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Inhibitor Subunit 11) and PPP1R37 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 37) are also associated with PP1, but their precise roles in glycogen metabolism are less clear. They may modulate the activity of PP1 in different contexts, potentially influencing glycogen storage or mobilization.

4. AATK (Apoptosis-Associated Tyrosine Kinase) and LMTK2 (Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2) are kinases that could be involved in signaling pathways that indirectly affect glycogen metabolism, although their direct roles in this process are not well established.

5. SNCAIP (Synuclein Alpha Interacting Protein) has been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and may have indirect effects on glycogen metabolism through neuronal signaling pathways.

6. The remaining proteins, such as C2orf74, C20orf27, CBARP, CCDC85B, CNST, CSRNP1, CSRNP2, ERBIN, NHLRC1, NNAT, PHACTR3, and the ZFYVE family members, do not have well-established roles in glycogen metabolism. Their inclusion in this analysis is based on less direct evidence or potential regulatory interactions that have yet to be fully characterized.

In summary, the primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of glycogen metabolism, with a focus on glycogen synthesis. The system includes key enzymes directly responsible for glycogen synthesis, regulatory subunits that modulate the activity of these enzymes, and additional proteins that may influence glycogen metabolism through signaling pathways or indirect interactions. The confidence score reflects the fact that while several proteins in the system are directly involved in glycogen metabolism, others have less clear roles or are involved in broader regulatory functions that may only peripherally impact this process."	0.85	glucan biosynthetic process	GO:0009250	1.0460489634640745e-07	5	45	19	ERBIN,GYG1,LMTK2,PHACTR3,PPP1R3B	0.0847457627118644	0.2631578947368421	GYG1 GYS1 PPP1R3B PPP1R3C	4.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Glycogen Metabolism and Regulation"" due to the presence of key enzymes and regulatory subunits directly involved in glycogen synthesis and metabolism.

The proteins AMPH, CPLX2, SNAP25, SNAP91, STX1B, SYN1, SYN2, SYP, SYT1, and SYT5 are all integral to synaptic transmission. They are involved in the docking, priming, and fusion of synaptic vesicles, as well as the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These proteins work in concert to ensure rapid and precise communication between neurons.

2. Proteins such as MAP2, MAPRE3, MAPT, and DCX are associated with microtubule stabilization and dynamics, which are crucial for neuronal structure, axonal transport, and the establishment of neuronal polarity during development and regeneration.

3. CAMKV, CNTN1, DCLK1, DPYSL5, EDIL3, GRIA2, HPCA, HPCAL1, L1CAM, LSAMP, NCALD, and VSNL1 are involved in neuronal signaling and plasticity. They participate in processes such as neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and calcium signaling, which are essential for learning, memory, and the overall function of neural networks.

4. CALB2, GNG2, and SNCB are calcium-binding proteins that regulate intracellular calcium levels, a key second messenger in various neuronal processes, including neurotransmitter release and gene expression.

5. ATP4A is a component of the proton pump responsible for acidifying the stomach. Its inclusion in this system may indicate a peripheral connection to neuronal control of gastric functions or may be an unrelated function.

6. DNAAF2 is known for its role in ciliary function and may be involved in the development of neuronal cilia or could be an outlier in this protein system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the development, structure, and function of neurons, particularly in the context of synaptic transmission and plasticity. The system reflects a complex network of proteins that work together to ensure proper neuronal communication, learning, and memory. The presence of a few proteins with less clear connections to neuronal function suggests additional peripheral roles or a minor degree of unrelated functions within the system."	0.95	vesicle-mediated transport in synapse	GO:0099003	1.973000355359184e-14	13	223	35	AMPH,CPLX2,ERC2,HPCA,SNAP25,SNAP91,SNCB,STX1B,SYN1,SYN2,SYP,SYT1,SYT5	0.0530612244897959	0.3714285714285714	AMPH CPLX2 SNAP25 SNAP91 STX1B SYN1 SYN2 SYP SYT1 SYT5 MAP2 MAPRE3 MAPT DCX CAMKV CNTN1 DCLK1 DPYSL5 EDIL3 GRIA2 HPCA HPCAL1 L1CAM LSAMP NCALD VSNL1 CALB2 GNG2 SNCB	29.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided list are definitively associated with neuronal development and synaptic function.

Several proteins in this system, such as STAT1, MYD88, OAS3, DHX58, and MX1, are key components of the immune response, particularly in the context of viral defense mechanisms. STAT1 is a critical transcription factor in the interferon signaling pathway, which is activated in response to viral infections. MYD88 is an adaptor protein that plays a central role in the innate immune response to pathogens. OAS3, DHX58 (also known as LGP2), and MX1 are involved in recognizing viral RNA and mediating antiviral responses.

2. Proteins like CFLAR, CASP4, BCL2L13, and MCL1 are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. CFLAR (also known as c-FLIP) is an inhibitor of death receptor signaling, which can prevent apoptosis. CASP4 is a caspase that can initiate inflammatory forms of cell death. BCL2L13 and MCL1 are members of the Bcl-2 family, which are key regulators of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

3. The presence of HLA-G, a non-classical MHC class I molecule, suggests a role in immune tolerance, particularly during pregnancy, where it contributes to the protection of the fetus from the maternal immune system.

4. Proteins such as NFKB2 and TRIM21 are involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, which is a central pathway in the immune response, inflammation, and cell survival.

5. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is represented by proteins like USP14, USP18, and UBA6, which are involved in protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes, including the immune response.

6. Proteins like NLRC5 and BATF2 are also associated with immune functions. NLRC5 is involved in the regulation of MHC class I genes, and BATF2 is a transcription factor that can be induced by interferons.

7. The system includes several proteins with roles in RNA processing and regulation, such as PNPT1, which is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing, and RBMS2, which is involved in mRNA stabilization.

8. Proteins like GALNT7 and MOCOS are involved in post-translational modifications and enzyme cofactor biosynthesis, respectively, which can indirectly affect various biological processes, including immune responses.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and homeostasis in the face of pathogenic challenge. The system also includes proteins that contribute to immune tolerance and the regulation of inflammation. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to infection and cellular stress, with mechanisms in place to regulate cell death and survival."	0.85	defense response to virus	GO:0051607	6.751249416623267e-08	13	312	71	TRIM21,USP18,OAS3,DHX58,STAT1,ZC3HAV1,NLRC5,MYD88,DTX3L,IFI44L,MX1,DDX60L,IFIT5	0.0351351351351351	0.1830985915492957	STAT1 MYD88 OAS3 DHX58 MX1 CFLAR CASP4 BCL2L13 MCL1 HLA-G NFKB2 TRIM21 USP14 USP18 UBA6 NLRC5 BATF2	17.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Immune Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" due to their definitive roles in antiviral defense, immune signaling, and apoptosis regulation as described in the text.

The proteins in this system exhibit a diverse range of functions, but a significant number are involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation. This includes proteins that participate in the cellular response to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and other forms of cellular injury.

2. TP53, a well-known tumor suppressor, plays a pivotal role in the response to DNA damage and other cellular stresses. It can induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis depending on the context and extent of damage.

3. CASP2 (caspase-2) and BIK (Bcl-2-interacting killer) are pro-apoptotic proteins that contribute to the initiation and execution phases of apoptosis. CASP2 is involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BIK is a member of the Bcl-2 family that can induce apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

4. Proteins such as HSPA1A (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 1A) and GLUL (glutamate-ammonia ligase) are involved in the cellular stress response. HSPA1A acts as a molecular chaperone, helping to refold proteins and prevent aggregation under stress conditions, while GLUL is implicated in nitrogen metabolism and can be upregulated in response to metabolic stress.

5. Antioxidant enzymes like GPX3 (glutathione peroxidase 3) protect cells from oxidative damage by reducing peroxides, which can be a source of cellular stress.

6. Several proteins in this system, such as CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and FOSL1 (FOS-like antigen 1), are involved in cell cycle regulation and can influence the cellular response to stress by halting cell cycle progression to allow for repair or to initiate apoptosis.

7. The presence of proteins like ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) and MMP7 (matrix metallopeptidase 7) indicates a role in extracellular matrix remodeling, which can be associated with tissue repair following injury or stress.

8. TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) is a component of the innate immune system and can trigger inflammatory responses to cellular damage or the presence of pathogens.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into pathways that detect and respond to cellular stress and damage. They work in concert to regulate apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and control cell cycle progression in response to various stress signals. The system's prominent biological process is the coordination of cellular stress responses and the regulation of apoptosis, which is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the propagation of damaged cells."	0.85	regulation of multicellular organismal process	GO:0051239	0.0001152947250975	29	2955	72	1060P11.3,ADAM17,CCL18,CD58,CPT1A,CST3,CTNNB1,FTH1,HNRNPL,KLF4,MAFF,NUTF2,GUSBP14,TFF3,TLR4,TMEM176B,TNFAIP6,TP53,BTG3,CDKN2A,CYP1B1,GABRP,GPM6B,HEBP1,HSPA1A,MMP7,PLA2G4A,SERPINA5,TFPI2	0.0096731154102735	0.4027777777777778	TP53 CASP2 BIK HSPA1A GPX3 CDKN2A TLR4	7.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" because they are explicitly involved in pathways that detect and respond to cellular stress, regulate apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and control cell cycle progression.

EGFR, or Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by binding of its specific ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). Upon activation, EGFR undergoes a transition from an inactive monomeric form to an active homodimer. This dimerization leads to autophosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the C-terminal domain of EGFR, which initiates a variety of downstream signaling pathways. These pathways include the MAPK, Akt, and JNK pathways, which are involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.

2. NR3C1, also known as the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), is a steroid hormone receptor that regulates gene expression in response to glucocorticoids.

It plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammatory responses, metabolism, and stress responses.

3. PRDX1, PRDX2, and PRDX5 are members of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes, which reduce peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, to water and alcohol, respectively. These enzymes play a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by regulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). They also participate in redox signaling by modulating the activity of various transcription factors and signaling molecules.

4. TXN, or Thioredoxin, is a small redox protein that acts as an antioxidant by facilitating the reduction of other proteins by cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange. Thioredoxin is part of the thioredoxin system, which includes thioredoxin reductase and NADPH, and plays a role in redox homeostasis. It is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis.

The proteins in this system are functionally integrated to manage cellular responses to oxidative stress and to regulate signal transduction pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and survival. EGFR and NR3C1 are key players in signal transduction, while PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX5, and TXN are central to maintaining redox balance within the cell. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to cellular stress, where signal transduction is modulated by the oxidative state of the cell, which is in turn regulated by the peroxiredoxins and thioredoxin. This system reflects a complex network where redox regulation is intimately linked with signaling pathways that are critical for cellular adaptation to stress and maintenance of homeostasis."	0.92	hydrogen peroxide metabolic process	GO:0042743	5.270133330141658e-10	5	55	6	EGFR,PRDX1,PRDX2,PRDX5,TXN	0.0892857142857142	0.8333333333333334	EGFR NR3C1 PRDX1 PRDX2 PRDX5 TXN	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Redox regulation and signal transduction in cellular stress response"" as it includes genes involved in both redox balance and signal transduction pathways.

The HOX family of proteins, including HOXA1 through HOXA6, HOXA11, HOXB2 through HOXB9, and HOXD3 through HOXD11, are transcription factors that play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. They are known for their involvement in patterning the anterior-posterior axis and specifying regional identity in the developing embryo.

2. The HOXA cluster proteins, such as HOXA1 and HOXA2, are essential for the proper development of the hindbrain and branchial arches. They are also implicated in the differentiation of various cell types and organs, including the limbs, gut, and reproductive system.

3. Similarly, the HOXB cluster proteins, including HOXB2 through HOXB9, are involved in the development of the axial skeleton, limbs, and genitourinary system. They contribute to the segmental organization of the embryo and are crucial for the formation of the vertebral column and thoracic cage.

4. The HOXD cluster proteins, such as HOXD3 through HOXD11, are particularly important for limb development, including the patterning of digits and the establishment of limb identity. They also play roles in the development of the urogenital system and the gastrointestinal tract.

5. The coordinated expression of HOX proteins is tightly regulated and involves complex interactions with other transcription factors, cofactors, and epigenetic modifiers. These interactions ensure the precise spatial and temporal expression patterns required for normal development.

6. The HOX proteins often function in a combinatorial manner, with multiple HOX proteins binding to DNA regulatory elements to control the expression of target genes. This combinatorial code contributes to the diversity of developmental outcomes and the specificity of tissue patterning.

To summarize, the HOX proteins in this system are central to the regulation of developmental gene expression. They are involved in the specification of body plan and the differentiation of structures along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. The system of interacting proteins functions in a highly coordinated and integrated manner to control the expression of genes critical for proper embryonic development."	0.98	embryonic skeletal system development	GO:0048706	2.3446415282655603e-35	18	128	21	HOXA2,HOXA3,HOXA4,HOXA5,HOXA6,HOXA11,HOXB2,HOXB3,HOXB4,HOXB5,HOXB6,HOXB7,HOXB8,HOXB9,HOXD3,HOXD4,HOXD9,HOXD10	0.1374045801526717	0.8571428571428571	HOXA1 HOXA2 HOXA3 HOXA4 HOXA5 HOXA6 HOXA11 HOXB2 HOXB3 HOXB4 HOXB5 HOXB6 HOXB7 HOXB8 HOXB9 HOXD3 HOXD4 HOXD8 HOXD9 HOXD10 HOXD11	21.0	"-- Summary --||The provided text describes the HOX family of proteins, including specific HOXA, HOXB, and HOXD cluster genes, as transcription factors crucial for regulating gene expression during embryonic development.

ARSA (arylsulfatase A) is involved in the degradation of sulfatides in lysosomes. Deficiency in ARSA activity leads to a lysosomal storage disorder known as metachromatic leukodystrophy, which affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system.

2. CNP (2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase) is an enzyme highly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the production of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides. It plays a role in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath.

3. GALNS (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase) is another lysosomal enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans, specifically keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Deficiencies in GALNS activity result in Morquio A syndrome, a type of mucopolysaccharidosis.

4. MYL7 (myosin light chain 7) is a cardiac-specific myosin light chain that is part of the contractile apparatus of cardiac muscle cells. It plays a role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction.

5. SMARCB1 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1) is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. It is involved in transcriptional regulation and is implicated in tumor suppression.

6. UACA (uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats) is a protein with less well-characterized functions, but it is thought to be involved in apoptosis and may play a role in autoimmune uveitis.

The proteins listed are involved in a variety of biological processes, including lysosomal degradation, myelin sheath maintenance, cardiac muscle contraction, chromatin remodeling, and potentially apoptosis and immune response. There is no single, prominent biological process that encompasses the functions of all these proteins. Instead, they participate in distinct and separate pathways within the cell. The interactions between these proteins, if any, do not suggest a unified biological process.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, overarching biological process, the proteins in this system appear to be involved in unrelated pathways. Therefore, the most appropriate name for the biological process performed by this system is:

Process: System of unrelated proteins (0.00)"	0.25	growth of unicellular organism as a thread of attached cells	GO:0070783	0.0076626810971341	1	1	5	SMARCB1	0.2	0.2	ARSA CNP GALNS MYL7 SMARCB1	5.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Diverse Cellular Functions and Pathways"" because they are involved in distinct and unrelated biological processes, such as lysosomal degradation, myelin sheath maintenance, cardiac muscle contraction, chromatin remodeling, and potentially apoptosis and immune response. This diversity aligns with the suggested name.||||-- Explanation --||ARSA: High||ARSA is involved in lysosomal degradation of sulfatides, a distinct function that supports the diversity of cellular functions.||||CNP: High||CNP is involved in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath, a specific function that contributes to the diversity of cellular pathways.||||GALNS: High||GALNS is involved in lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans, another distinct function that supports the diversity of cellular functions.||||MYL7: High||MYL7 is involved in cardiac muscle contraction, a specific and unrelated function that contributes to the diversity of cellular pathways.||||SMARCB1: High||SMARCB1 is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, a distinct function that supports the diversity of cellular functions.||||UACA: Medium||UACA is thought to be involved in apoptosis and potentially autoimmune uveitis, which are less well-characterized but still distinct functions contributing to the diversity of cellular pathways.||||-- genes supporting the name: ARSA, CNP, GALNS, MYL7, SMARCB1, UACA||-- genes supporting the name with confidence = High:

GYG1 and GYG2 are glycogenin proteins that serve as the core upon which glycogen synthase (GYS1) can begin glycogen synthesis. GYG1 and GYG2 are involved in the autoglucosylation that initiates glycogen granule formation, while GYS1 extends the glycogen molecule by adding glucose units.

2. PPP1R3C, PPP1R10, PPP1R11, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, and PPP1R37 are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1 is a major enzyme that dephosphorylates glycogen synthase, activating it for glycogen synthesis, and glycogen phosphorylase, inactivating it to stop glycogen breakdown. These regulatory subunits target PP1 to specific subcellular locations and modulate its activity towards specific substrates, including those involved in glycogen metabolism.

3. UGP2 encodes for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2, an enzyme that produces UDP-glucose, a direct precursor for glycogen synthesis. This links the protein to glycogen metabolism as well.

4. AATK, LMTK2, SH3RF2, and SHOC2 are involved in signal transduction pathways that can influence cell survival, apoptosis, and possibly metabolic processes, although their direct roles in glycogen metabolism are not as clear as the other proteins mentioned.

5. CLOCK is a core component of the circadian clock, which regulates rhythms in physiology and behavior, including glucose metabolism. It forms a heterodimer with BMAL1 and regulates the transcription of various clock-controlled genes.

6. CIPC, TOX4, and ZFYVE16 are associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms and may indirectly influence metabolic processes through the modulation of circadian-controlled genes.

7. CNST, CSRNP1, PEAK1, PHACTR1, PHACTR3, PPP1R10, TPRN, and ZFYVE9 are proteins with diverse functions, including roles in cytoskeletal organization, RNA splicing, and signal transduction. Their direct involvement in glycogen metabolism or circadian regulation is not well established based on current knowledge.

To summarize, a significant number of proteins in this system are directly involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, with a subset also linked to the circadian regulation of metabolic processes. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated regulation of glucose homeostasis that is influenced by the circadian clock, which could have implications for understanding diseases such as diabetes where both glycogen metabolism and circadian rhythms are disrupted.

ICE1 (Interactor of little elongation complex ELL subunit 1) and ICE2 are components of the Little Elongation Complex (LEC) which is involved in the regulation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene transcription. They interact with the transcription machinery to modulate transcription elongation and are implicated in the control of gene expression.

2. MED26 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a multiprotein complex that functions as a transcriptional coactivator in all eukaryotes. It is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and bridges the transcriptional regulators bound to enhancers and the core transcription machinery at promoters.

3. MLLT6 (Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to, 6) and MLLT10 (Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to, 10) are components of super elongation complexes (SECs) that are associated with chromatin modification and transcriptional elongation. They are known to be involved in hematopoiesis and may play a role in leukemogenesis.

4. TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is one of the cytokines that make up the acute phase reaction. It is produced chiefly by activated macrophages, although it can be produced by other cell types as well. TNF's primary role is in the regulation of immune cells, but it can also induce apoptotic cell death, inflammation, and inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of transcription and the inflammatory response. ICE1, ICE2, MED26, MLLT6, and MLLT10 are all associated with transcriptional regulation, either through the modulation of elongation or the bridging of transcriptional regulators to the core transcription machinery. TNF, while not directly involved in transcription, plays a significant role in the inflammatory response, which can be influenced by transcriptional regulation. The interplay between these proteins suggests a system that integrates transcriptional regulation with the cellular response to inflammation."	0.85	positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription	GO:0045893	0.0001656148874248	6	1703	6	ICE1,ICE2,MED26,MLLT6,MLLT10,TNF	0.003523194362889	1.0	ICE1 ICE2 MED26 MLLT6 MLLT10 TNF	6.0	-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly involves transcriptional regulation and inflammatory response.

ACTL6A, CHD3, and ING4 are components of chromatin remodeling complexes that alter the structure of chromatin to regulate access to DNA. ACTL6A is part of the SWI/SNF complex, which is involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes. CHD3 is a member of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex, which has roles in chromatin compaction and gene silencing. ING4 associates with histone acetyltransferase complexes and can modulate chromatin structure and transcription.

2. BCL6, CREBBP, EP300, NR3C1, RELA, RUNX1, TP53, and YY1 are transcription factors or co-regulators that directly influence gene expression. BCL6 is a sequence-specific repressor of transcription, while CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that activate transcription by remodeling chromatin. NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response. RELA is a subunit of NF-kB, a transcription factor involved in inflammatory and immune responses. RUNX1 is critical for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. TP53 (p53) is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in apoptosis, growth arrest, and DNA repair. YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor that can act as an activator, repressor, or initiator-binding protein.

3. H2AFZ and HIST1H4A are histone variants; H2AFZ is a replacement for the canonical histone H2A and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. HIST1H4A is a core component of the nucleosome, and its post-translational modifications are critical for transcriptional regulation.

4. HNRNPD (also known as AUF1) is an RNA-binding protein that influences mRNA stability and turnover, thereby indirectly affecting gene expression.

5. KAT6A and TERT are involved in modifying chromatin structure and telomere maintenance, respectively. KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase that can regulate transcription through chromatin remodeling. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, can also regulate gene expression independently of its role in telomere elongation.

6. MTA3, PML, TBL1XR1, and TNF are involved in various aspects of chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation. MTA3 is a component of the NuRD complex, like CHD3, and is involved in gene silencing. PML is involved in the formation of nuclear bodies and can regulate transcription. TBL1XR1 is part of the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex, which mediates transcriptional repression. TNF is primarily known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine but can also influence gene expression through activation of NF-kB.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure and transcription. They work in concert to modulate gene expression patterns necessary for various cellular processes, including development, metabolism, immune response, and maintenance of genomic integrity. The interplay between these proteins facilitates the precise and context-dependent regulation of transcription, ensuring proper cellular function and response to environmental cues."	0.92	positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription	GO:0045893	3.730313113859868e-17	19	1703	20	ACTL6A,AR,CHD3,CREBBP,EP300,H2AZ1,H4C1,HNRNPD,ING4,KAT6A,MTA3,NR3C1,PML,RELA,RUNX1,TBL1XR1,TERT,TNF,TP53	0.011150234741784	0.95	ACTL6A CHD3 ING4 BCL6 CREBBP EP300 NR3C1 RELA RUNX1 TP53 YY1 H2AFZ HIST1H4A KAT6A MTA3 PML TBL1XR1	17.0	-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly involves genes that play roles in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

ATF2, CREB1, and CREBBP are transcription factors and transcriptional coactivators, respectively, that play a central role in cellular response to a variety of extracellular signals. ATF2 and CREB1 are members of the cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein family, which are phosphorylated by various kinases, leading to their activation and subsequent binding to DNA to regulate gene expression. CREBBP (CBP) acts as a scaffold to stabilize additional protein interactions with the transcription machinery and is also a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that modifies chromatin to promote transcriptional activation.

2. CSNK2A1 encodes for casein kinase 2 alpha, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control and DNA repair. It can phosphorylate a multitude of substrates, including some of the proteins in this system, potentially modulating their activity.

3. DAXX, HDAC1, and HMGA proteins (HMGA1 and HMGA2) are involved in chromatin remodeling and structure. DAXX acts as a chaperone for histone deposition and transcriptional repression, while HDAC1 is a histone deacetylase that removes acetyl groups from histones, leading to a closed chromatin conformation and transcriptional repression. HMGA proteins are architectural transcription factors that can alter chromatin structure to facilitate the assembly of transcriptional complexes.

4. EP300, similar to CREBBP, possesses histone acetyltransferase activity and is involved in the regulation of transcription via chromatin remodeling. It can acetylate both histone and non-histone proteins, thereby influencing gene expression patterns.

5. NCOA6, NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor), and PPARG (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) are nuclear receptors and coactivators that regulate gene expression in response to hormonal and other signals. They are involved in various metabolic processes and stress responses.

6. NPM1, PARP1, PML, PSIP1, RB1, SYNCRIP, TERT, TGS1, USP7, and XRCC6 are proteins with diverse roles in the nucleus, including ribosome biogenesis (NPM1), DNA repair and chromatin remodeling (PARP1, XRCC6), regulation of gene expression and apoptosis (PML), integration of viral DNA into the host genome (PSIP1), cell cycle control (RB1), telomere maintenance (TERT), mRNA processing (TGS1, SYNCRIP), protein stabilization and deubiquitination (USP7).

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure and transcription. They interact in a complex network that integrates signals from various pathways to modulate gene expression patterns in response to cellular needs. The system is characterized by a balance of transcriptional activators and repressors, chromatin remodelers, and signaling mediators that together contribute to the precise control of gene expression."	0.92	positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription	GO:0045893	1.4643542473819534e-14	18	1703	21	ATF2,CREB1,CREBBP,DAXX,EP300,HDAC1,HMGA1,HMGA2,NCOA6,NPM1,NR3C1,PARP1,PML,PPARG,PSIP1,RB1,SYNCRIP,USP7	0.0105509964830011	0.8571428571428571	ATF2 CREB1 CREBBP DAXX HDAC1 HMGA1 HMGA2 EP300 NCOA6 NR3C1 PPARG	11.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

DPP6, KCND2, KCND3, KCNE4, KCNIP1, KCNIP2, and KCNIP4 are all proteins that are associated with the modulation of voltage-gated potassium channels. These channels are critical for setting the resting membrane potential and shaping the action potentials in neurons. DPP6 is known to modulate the function of A-type potassium channels, which are involved in controlling neuronal excitability. KCND2 and KCND3 encode for the Kv4 family of potassium channels, which contribute to the A-type current, particularly in the heart and brain. KCNE4 is a potassium channel regulatory subunit that can modulate the function of other potassium channels, including KCND2 and KCND3.

2. SRSF3 is a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor that plays a role in splice site selection during the processing of pre-mRNA. It can influence the expression of ion channels by modulating alternative splicing events, which can lead to the production of different channel isoforms with distinct electrical properties.

3. SUGP2 is involved in mRNA splicing and may also influence the expression and function of proteins involved in neuronal excitability through the regulation of alternative splicing.

4. TARDBP, also known as TDP-43, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates gene expression at multiple levels, including transcription, mRNA splicing, and stability. It has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and may affect neuronal function by altering the expression of genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion channel regulation.

5. TRNAU1AP is a tRNA splicing ligase complex protein that is involved in the splicing of precursor tRNAs. While its direct role in neuronal excitability is not clear, it may have an indirect effect through the regulation of protein synthesis, including proteins that modulate ion channel function.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability through the modulation of voltage-gated potassium channels. They achieve this by directly altering the properties of the channels or by regulating the expression of channel subunits and associated proteins. The presence of splicing factors suggests a regulatory network that could fine-tune the expression of ion channel subunits and other related proteins, thereby influencing neuronal excitability and signal propagation in the nervous system."	0.92	potassium ion transmembrane transport	GO:0071805	1.227880492889544e-09	7	212	11	DPP6,KCND2,KCND3,KCNE4,KCNIP1,KCNIP2,KCNIP4	0.0324074074074074	0.6363636363636364	DPP6 KCND2 KCND3 KCNE4 KCNIP1 KCNIP2 KCNIP4	7.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability and ion channel function, either directly by modulating voltage-gated potassium channels or indirectly through the regulation of mRNA splicing and protein synthesis.

The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.

2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.

3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.

4. Proteins such as SLC34A1, SLC15A3, and SLC23A2 are transporters that facilitate the movement of specific substrates across cellular membranes. SLC34A1 is a phosphate transporter, SLC15A3 is a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, and SLC23A2 is a vitamin C transporter.

5. The presence of proteins like IDH3A, LDHB, and GYS1 indicates involvement in metabolic processes. IDH3A is a subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase involved in the TCA cycle, LDHB is involved in lactate metabolism, and GYS1 is glycogen synthase, which plays a role in glycogen biosynthesis.

6. Proteins such as OPTN, CEACAM1, and PLAUR are implicated in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions. OPTN is involved in autophagy and NF-κB signaling, CEACAM1 participates in cell adhesion and signaling, and PLAUR (uPAR) is involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling.

To summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.

Given the complexity and diversity of the protein functions, the confidence score is not at the maximum, as not all proteins are directly involved in the identified processes. However, the prominence of the innate immune response and apoptosis regulation components justifies a relatively high confidence score."	0.85	response to external stimulus	GO:0009605	7.207538037741957e-05	29	2723	79	ADAMTS18,ZNF71,LOC283745,NMUR2,ADGRF1,BRIP1,LRRC40,STAT2,SAMD9L,IFIH1,RTP4,IFIT2,ISG20,CD274,ZBP1,APOL6,IL4I1,OPTN,PLAUR,RHBDF2,IRF1-AS1,PHF11,LGALS9,RP2,GREM2,IPO11,ENY2,OSBP2,LNPK	0.0104579877389109	0.3670886075949367	IFIH1 STAT2 IRF1 TLR3 CD274 ISG20 IFIT2 CXCL11 CASP10 BCL2L11 RELA	11.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Innate Immune Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" due to the presence of multiple genes with definite roles in these processes.

RNMT, the RNA (guanine-7-) methyltransferase, is involved in mRNA cap methylation, which is crucial for mRNA stability and efficient translation, processes that are particularly important under stress conditions where protein synthesis needs to be tightly regulated.

2. SAMD9L, the sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein, has been implicated in the innate immune response and may also play a role in cellular stress responses, potentially by regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis.

3. CEBPB and CEBPG are members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family and function as transcription factors that regulate genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, as well as in cellular metabolism, particularly under stress conditions.

4. PSMD12, a component of the 19S proteasome, is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process that is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, especially during cellular stress when damaged proteins accumulate.

5. RSRC2 and HNRNPA1 are RNA-binding proteins that influence RNA splicing and stability, which are critical for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during stress responses.

6. XBP1 is a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to restore normal function by enhancing the production of molecular chaperones and components of the protein degradation machinery.

7. GADD45A is involved in the response to environmental stress and DNA damage, and it plays a role in growth arrest and apoptosis, which are important for cellular recovery and adaptation to stress.

8. USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can regulate the stability of proteins involved in the DNA damage response and may also influence other stress response pathways.

9. HIAT1, MSANTD3, NDFIP1, WRB, KLHL36, EIF2A, CALML4, GCLM, KDM5B, GNA12, ZNF655, and METTL21B are proteins with various functions, including neurotransmitter transport (HIAT1), regulation of gene expression (MSANTD3, KDM5B, ZNF655), protein translation initiation (EIF2A), calcium signaling (CALML4), redox homeostasis (GCLM), and protein methylation (METTL21B). These proteins may contribute to the overall cellular response to stress by modulating specific pathways or cellular processes.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a coordinated response to cellular stress, which includes the regulation of gene expression, mRNA processing, protein synthesis, and degradation, as well as DNA repair and cell cycle control. The system reflects a multifaceted approach to maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity under stress conditions, with a significant proportion of the proteins directly participating in stress response pathways."	0.85	hepatocyte proliferation	GO:0072574	0.0163492276917296	2	24	18	CEBPB,XBP1	0.05	0.1111111111111111	RNMT CEBPB CEBPG PSMD12 XBP1 GADD45A	6.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Protein Homeostasis"" as they are involved in various processes critical for managing cellular stress, including mRNA processing, protein synthesis and degradation, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), EPAS1 (Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1), and TSC22D3 (TSC22 domain family protein 3), are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. DDIT4 is a modulator of the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. EPAS1, also known as HIF-2α, is a transcription factor that responds to hypoxia and regulates genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. TSC22D3 is a glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein that can regulate inflammatory responses and cellular growth.

2. The presence of metabolic enzymes such as ASNS (asparagine synthetase), GLS (glutaminase), PCK2 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2), and PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) indicates a role in metabolic regulation. ASNS is involved in the biosynthesis of asparagine and adaptation to cellular stress, while GLS catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, a key step in energy and nitrogen metabolism. PCK2 is an enzyme in gluconeogenesis, converting oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and PGK1 is a glycolytic enzyme, highlighting the system's involvement in balancing energy production and consumption.

3. Chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL11, along with their regulatory proteins, suggest a role in immune response and inflammation. These chemokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, which is critical during stress and injury.

4. Proteins like CAV1 (caveolin 1) and ENPP2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2) are involved in signal transduction and lipid metabolism, respectively. CAV1 is a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes, influencing various signaling pathways, while ENPP2 is involved in the generation of lysophosphatidic acid, a lipid signaling molecule.

5. Growth factors and their regulators, such as AREG (amphiregulin), EREG (epiregulin), BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4), and FAM129A (family with sequence similarity 129 member A), are indicative of roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development.

6. The presence of XIST (X inactive specific transcript) suggests a connection to epigenetic regulation, as XIST is involved in X-chromosome inactivation, a process of dosage compensation in females.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, immune response, signal transduction, and growth factor activity. The system appears to be geared towards maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes, with a significant number of proteins contributing to these processes. The name ""Cellular Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation"" reflects the dual focus on managing cellular stress and regulating metabolic pathways, which is supported by a majority of the genes in the system."	0.85	animal organ morphogenesis	GO:0009887	0.0002616143170836	12	1035	41	1060P11.3,ASNS,BMP4,CAV1,CD200,DPYSL3,EPAS1,NIBAN1,H2BC5,TES,XIST,HOXC6	0.0112781954887218	0.2926829268292683	DDIT4 EPAS1 TSC22D3 ASNS GLS PCK2 PGK1 CXCL1 CXCL8 CXCL9 CXCL11 CAV1 ENPP2 AREG EREG BMP4 FAM129A XIST	18.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation"" by being directly involved in cellular stress responses, metabolic processes, immune responses, and signal transduction.

CRHR1 (Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a central role in the stress response by mediating the effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). It is involved in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex.

2. UCN (Urocortin) is a member of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family and binds to CRHR1, modulating the stress response and inflammatory reactions. It is implicated in various physiological processes, including vasodilation and myocardial contractility.

3. STIM1 (Stromal interaction molecule 1) and STIM2 are calcium sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that transduce signals to the plasma membrane to control calcium influx, a process essential for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, gene expression, and cell growth.

4. THBS3 (Thrombospondin 3) and THBS4 (Thrombospondin 4) are matricellular proteins that modulate cell-matrix interactions and are involved in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and regulation of synaptogenesis. They can influence intracellular signaling pathways and have roles in the response to stress and injury.

5. ZHX1, ZHX2, and ZHX3 (Zinc fingers and homeoboxes protein 1, 2, and 3) are transcriptional repressors that can form heterodimers and are involved in the regulation of gene expression, including genes related to cell differentiation and development.

6. DYRK4 (Dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 4) is a kinase that may be involved in spermatogenesis and could play a role in signal transduction pathways that are activated in response to stress or changes in cellular energy levels.

7. RNF123 (RING finger protein 123) is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that may be involved in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway, which regulates protein turnover and signal transduction pathways.

8. UBAC1 (UBA domain-containing protein 1) is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and stress responses.

9. UVSSA (UV-stimulated scaffold protein A) is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, a process that repairs DNA damage induced by UV light and other genotoxic stressors.

10. CRIPAK (CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PAK1 knockout) is not a protein but a method for gene editing. It may be a misidentified element in this list, as it does not represent a biological process or protein function.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in various aspects of the cellular stress response, including the modulation of the HPA axis, regulation of calcium signaling, tissue remodeling, gene expression, and DNA damage repair. The system also includes proteins that participate in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is integral to protein turnover and signaling modulation in response to stress. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to cellular stress and the maintenance of homeostasis through intracellular signaling modulation."	0.85	activation of store-operated calcium channel activity	GO:0032237	0.001234826589467	2	5	12	DYRK4,RNF123	0.1333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	CRHR1 UCN STIM1 STIM2 UVSSA	5.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Stress Response and Intracellular Signaling Modulation"" as they are involved in various aspects of the cellular stress response, including the HPA axis, calcium signaling, tissue remodeling, gene expression, DNA damage repair, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1), DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase), SQLE (squalene epoxidase), LSS (lanosterol synthase), and CYP51A1 (cytochrome P450 family 51 subfamily A member 1), are key enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. These enzymes work sequentially to convert acetyl-CoA into cholesterol, a fundamental component of cell membranes and precursor for steroid hormones.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are involved in the regulation of cholesterol levels. INSIG1 is a crucial mediator in the feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, while LDLR is responsible for the uptake of cholesterol into cells via endocytosis of LDL particles.

3. ACSL3 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3) and SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) are involved in fatty acid metabolism. ACSL3 activates long-chain fatty acids for both synthesis of cellular lipids and degradation via beta-oxidation. SCD is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids.

4. FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) is another enzyme involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are essential components of cell membranes and precursors to signaling molecules.

5. APOD (apolipoprotein D) is a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and is involved in lipid transport and metabolism.

6. INSR (insulin receptor) and IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) are key components of the insulin signaling pathway, which has significant effects on lipid metabolism by influencing the activity of enzymes such as lipases and lipoprotein lipase.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and metabolism of cholesterol and lipids.

Several proteins in this system, such as CD44, VCAN (Versican), and CHI3L1 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1), are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. VCAN is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in tissue remodeling and is often upregulated in various cancers.

2. Proteins like EXT1 (Exostosin-1) and XYLT1 (Xylosyltransferase 1) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, respectively. These activities are crucial for the structure and function of the ECM, which is a key component of the tumor microenvironment.

3. The presence of proteins such as TNFRSF21 (Death receptor 6) and TNFSF10 (TRAIL) indicates involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways. These proteins can modulate cell death and survival, which are critical processes in cancer progression and response to therapy.

4. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family of proteins that are involved in regulating cell fate and patterning during development. In the context of cancer, WNT5A has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.

5. The system includes immune-related proteins such as IGHM, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20, and IGL, which are components of immunoglobulins. These suggest a role in immune surveillance or response within the tumor microenvironment.

6. Proteins like TGFBR2 (Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II) and S100A6 are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGFBR2 is a key mediator of TGF-beta signaling, which has complex roles in tumor progression, including tumor suppression in early stages and promotion of invasion and metastasis in later stages.

7. The presence of XIST, a long non-coding RNA involved in X chromosome inactivation, suggests a potential role in epigenetic regulation within the system, although its specific role in this context is less clear.

In summary, the proteins in this system are collectively involved in the dynamic modulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly through ECM remodeling, cell adhesion, migration, immune response, and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival. The interplay of these proteins contributes to the structural and functional complexity of the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression and metastasis."	0.85	animal organ formation	GO:0048645	0.0040361701254554	4	70	35	CHI3L1,VCAN,DDX3Y,MSRB2	0.0396039603960396	0.1142857142857142	CD44 VCAN CHI3L1 EXT1 XYLT1 TNFRSF21 TNFSF10 WNT5A TGFBR2 S100A6	10.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the given name ""Tumor Microenvironment Modulation and Extracellular Matrix Remodeling"" due to their roles in ECM remodeling, cell adhesion, migration, immune response, and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival.

ATF1, ATF4, CREB1, and CREM are members of the Activating Transcription Factor (ATF)/cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB) protein family. These transcription factors can form homo- or heterodimers and bind to cAMP response elements (CRE) in DNA, regulating the transcription of genes in response to hormonal and stress signals. ATF4 is particularly known for its role in the cellular stress response, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), and amino acid metabolism.

2. BATF and JDP2 are basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. BATF forms dimers with Jun proteins and is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and differentiation of immune cells. JDP2 represses transcription by forming inactive complexes with other transcription factors and is implicated in cellular stress response mechanisms.

3. CEBPG (also known as C/EBP gamma) is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and functions as a transcriptional regulator involved in cell cycle and metabolism. It can act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of other C/EBP family members.

4. DDIT3 (also known as CHOP) is a transcription factor induced by cellular stress, particularly during the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. It is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and can heterodimerize with ATF4.

5. GABBR1 and GABBR2 encode the subunits of the GABA(B) receptor, which is involved in neurotransmission. While not directly related to transcriptional regulation, their interaction with the system could suggest a role in cellular signaling pathways that influence gene expression.

6. GOLGA1 (also known as golgin A1) is involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and may play a role in the trafficking of proteins that are crucial for transcriptional regulation.

7. JAKMIP1 (Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1) is associated with microtubules and may be involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene expression.

8. MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein) is a transcription factor that can bind to G/C-rich DNA sequences and is implicated in gene expression regulation and DNA repair.

9. POU6F1 (POU class 6 homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that may play a role in the development of the nervous system and in the regulation of gene expression.

10. UTF1 (Undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1) is associated with maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and may regulate gene expression during early development.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to cellular stress and developmental signals. They include transcription factors that respond to stress, regulate metabolism, and control developmental processes. The presence of GABA(B) receptor subunits suggests a potential link to signal transduction pathways that modulate the activity of these transcription factors. The system appears to be functionally integrated around the regulation of gene expression in response to various intracellular and extracellular stimuli, with a significant emphasis on the cellular stress response."	0.92	positive regulation of RNA biosynthetic process	GO:1902680	0.0006218248366263	8	1706	14	ATF1,ATF4,BATF,CEBPG,CREB1,CREM,JDP2,POU6F1	0.0046728971962616	0.5714285714285714	ATF1 ATF4 CREB1 CREM BATF JDP2 CEBPG DDIT3 MAZ POU6F1 UTF1	11.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the given name ""Cellular Stress Response and Gene Expression Regulation"" because they are predominantly involved in transcriptional regulation in response to cellular stress and developmental signals.

The proteins AR (androgen receptor), THRB (thyroid hormone receptor beta), and RELA (a subunit of NF-kB) are transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate the transcription of target genes. These factors are activated by their respective ligands and play critical roles in processes such as metabolism, cell proliferation, and immune responses.

2. Coactivators such as NCOA1, NCOA2, NCOA3 (nuclear receptor coactivators), CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1), CREBBP (CREB-binding protein), and EP300 (E1A binding protein p300) interact with transcription factors to enhance their transcriptional activity. They function by modifying chromatin structure through acetylation and methylation, thereby facilitating the assembly of the transcriptional machinery.

3. HDAC2 and HDAC3 (histone deacetylases) are involved in chromatin remodeling through the removal of acetyl groups from histones, leading to a more condensed chromatin state and transcriptional repression. They counterbalance the activity of histone acetyltransferases like CREBBP and EP300.

4. HIST1H3A represents the histone proteins that are subject to post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, which affect chromatin structure and gene expression.

5. SMARCE1 is part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex that alters chromatin structure to regulate gene expression by facilitating nucleosome sliding.

6. TP53BP1 and MDM2 are involved in the DNA damage response. TP53BP1 is a mediator of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks, while MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates the p53 tumor suppressor.

7. SMAD2 is a signal transducer for TGF-beta receptors, which regulates gene expression in response to TGF-beta signaling.

8. COPS2 is part of the COP9 signalosome, a complex that regulates protein stability and degradation, and may indirectly influence transcriptional regulation.

9. LCOR is a ligand-dependent nuclear receptor corepressor that modulates the activity of various transcription factors.

10. PSME3 and TSG101 are involved in protein degradation pathways, with PSME3 being part of the proteasome and TSG101 part of the ESCRT complex, both of which can regulate the turnover of transcription factors and co-regulators.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling and transcriptional control. They work in concert to modulate the accessibility of transcriptional machinery to DNA, the activity of transcription factors, and the stability of regulatory proteins. The system reflects a tightly regulated network that integrates signals from various pathways to control cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and response to stress."	0.92	negative regulation of nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process	GO:0045934	4.266628702670973e-12	16	1588	20	AR,COPS2,CREBBP,E2F1,EP300,HDAC2,HDAC3,H3C1,LCOR,NCOA1,PSME3,RELA,SMAD2,SMARCE1,THRB,TP53BP1	0.0100502512562814	0.8	AR THRB RELA NCOA1 NCOA2 NCOA3 CARM1 CREBBP EP300 HDAC2 HDAC3 HIST1H3A SMARCE1 LCOR	14.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation"" as they are involved in processes such as chromatin remodeling, transcriptional activation, and repression, as well as the regulation of transcription factor activity.

3. ZFP36L2 (Zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 2) is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. It binds to adenine-uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs and promotes their degradation, thus playing a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level during stress responses.

4. S100A10 (S100 calcium-binding protein A10) is implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. It is also known to play a role in the stress response, particularly in the context of inflammation.

5. ADRB2 (Beta-2 adrenergic receptor) is involved in the response to adrenaline and noradrenaline in various tissues. Activation of this receptor leads to a cascade of events involved in the fight-or-flight response and can also modulate the immune response and apoptosis.

6. AKR1B1 (Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B) is part of the polyol pathway and is involved in the detoxification of aldehydes and ketones, which are products of oxidative stress.

7. OAS1 (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1) is an interferon-induced protein that plays a role in the antiviral response and can induce apoptosis in cells that are infected with a virus.

8. SULF1 (Sulfatase 1) modulates the sulfation state of proteoglycans and is implicated in cellular response to growth factors and in the regulation of cell signaling in response to cellular stress.

9. Other proteins in the list, such as DAB2, EGLN3, MFAP5, MXRA5, PLEKHM1, PTPRE, SLC38A1, SPTSSA, CHGB, CRISP3, CYBA, ENC1, HLA-DMB, HOMER2, NME4, RARRES1, SORD, STX1A, and UGCG, are involved in various cellular processes including signal transduction, metabolism, vesicle trafficking, immune response, and membrane transport. While they may not directly relate to a single cohesive process, their functions can intersect with cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in a range of processes, but a significant number of them play roles in the cellular response to stress and the regulation of apoptosis. These proteins interact in complex ways to maintain cellular integrity and respond to damage, with implications for cell survival, cell cycle control, and programmed cell death. The confidence score reflects the fact that while many proteins in the system contribute to these processes, not all are directly involved, and the system represents a network with diverse functions."	0.85	fructose biosynthetic process	GO:0046370	0.0026125688652936	2	2	27	AKR1B1,SORD	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	CHEK1 PDCD4 ZFP36L2 OAS1	4.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" because they are involved in processes such as DNA damage response, apoptosis, post-transcriptional regulation during stress, inflammation response, oxidative stress detoxification, antiviral response, and modulation of cell signaling in response to stress.

AK2 (Adenylate Kinase 2) is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space where it catalyzes the conversion of AMP and ATP into two molecules of ADP, an important reaction in cellular energy homeostasis. It plays a role in maintaining the adenine nucleotide pool within the mitochondria, which is critical for ATP synthesis and energy transfer throughout the cell.

2. CDH1 (E-Cadherin) is a transmembrane protein that mediates calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion and is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the epithelium. It is involved in mechanisms that regulate cell polarity, tissue architecture, and suppression of cancer progression.

3. HADHA and HADHB are subunits of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), an enzyme complex anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane that catalyzes three steps in the beta-oxidation spiral of long-chain fatty acids. This process is essential for the conversion of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle for energy production.

4. MT-ATP8 and MT-ND4L are components of the mitochondrial DNA-encoded ATP synthase and NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), respectively. These proteins are integral to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which generates the majority of cellular ATP through the electron transport chain.

5. SQSTM1 (Sequestosome 1), also known as p62, is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various signaling pathways, including selective autophagy, and is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. It also plays a role in oxidative stress response and may be implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and function.

In summary, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, including the generation and regulation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Additionally, CDH1 introduces an element of cellular adhesion, which is essential for tissue organization and integrity. The interplay between these proteins supports the critical balance between energy production, utilization, and the structural maintenance of cellular and tissue architecture."	0.85	ribonucleotide biosynthetic process	GO:0009260	0.0035461878259708	3	231	7	AK2,MT-ATP8,MT-ND4L	0.0127659574468085	0.4285714285714285	AK2 CDH1 HADHA HADHB MT-ATP8 MT-ND4L	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism and Cellular Adhesion"" due to the involvement of most genes in mitochondrial functions related to energy metabolism, such as ATP synthesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation.

HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. It is subject to complex regulation by various mechanisms, including feedback inhibition by cholesterol derivatives.

2. HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1) is another key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, catalyzing the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is then reduced by HMGCR.

3. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) is a regulatory protein that binds to HMGCR and facilitates its degradation, thus playing a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis. It acts as a mediator of sterol-regulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HMGCR.

4. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, which is a primary mechanism for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream and regulating intracellular cholesterol levels.

5. PCSK1 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1) is an enzyme that processes precursor proteins into their active forms. It is involved in the maturation of proteins that participate in cholesterol metabolism, such as proproteins that become receptors or enzymes in lipid metabolic pathways.

The proteins listed above are directly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, indicating a system primarily engaged in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation. The interplay between these proteins ensures that cholesterol levels within cells and in the bloodstream are tightly controlled, which is critical for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and producing steroid hormones and bile acids.

Other proteins in the system, such as 1060P11.3, AEBP1, AMIGO2, CNPY3, FABP7, PLK2, RCAN1, SCGB1D2, SCGB2A2, ST6GAL1, TFAP2A, VTCN1, APLP2, BAG3, CDC42EP3, FERMT1, HSPB8, ID1, KCNJ15, STX1A, UBE2S, VCAN, WFDC2, and ZNF652, may have roles in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune response, and protein folding. However, their direct involvement in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation is not as clear from the information provided. Therefore, while the primary process is confidently identified, the presence of these additional proteins suggests a broader range of cellular activities, which slightly lowers the confidence score."	0.85	positive regulation of aggrephagy	GO:1905337	0.0031354526456764	2	3	27	APLP2,FERMT1	0.0714285714285714	0.074074074074074	HMGCR HMGCS1 INSIG1 LDLR	4.0	"-- Summary --||The genes HMGCR, HMGCS1, INSIG1, LDLR, and PCSK1 are directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation.

The proteins ANKRD39, BTBD9, KCTD9, KCTD11, KLHL2, KLHL3, KLHL12, KLHL22, KLHL25, RHOBTB2, RHOBTB3, and SHKBP1 share a common theme in their involvement with the Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes. These proteins often serve as substrate adaptors or regulators for CRLs, which are responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins.

2. The KLHL (Kelch-like) family members, including KLHL2, KLHL3, KLHL12, KLHL22, and KLHL25, typically contain BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac) domains that facilitate the formation of CRL complexes by interacting with Cullin proteins and RING-box proteins. They are implicated in various cellular processes through the targeted degradation of proteins.

3. The KCTD (Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain containing) proteins, such as KCTD9 and KCTD11, also contain BTB domains and are involved in the assembly and regulation of CRL complexes. They contribute to the specificity of the ubiquitination process by recognizing and binding to specific substrates.

4. RHOBTB2 and RHOBTB3 are atypical members of the Rho family and have been implicated in the regulation of CRL3 complexes. They may act as adaptors or regulators within these complexes, influencing the ubiquitination of various proteins.

5. WNK (With No lysine (K)) kinases, including WNK1, WNK2, WNK3, and WNK4, are a family of serine/threonine-protein kinases that do not directly interact with CRL complexes but are known to be involved in the regulation of ion transport and signaling pathways. Their activity can be modulated by ubiquitination, suggesting a potential indirect link with the CRL system through regulation of kinase activity or stability.

6. SHKBP1 acts as an adaptor that links WNK kinases to the CRL3 complex, suggesting a coordinated regulation of WNK kinase activity and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes, which play a critical role in protein turnover and cellular homeostasis. The WNK kinases, while not directly part of the CRL complexes, are subject to regulation by ubiquitination, which may be facilitated by the action of the other proteins in this system. The interplay between these proteins ensures precise control of protein degradation, affecting various cellular processes."	0.85	negative regulation of pancreatic juice secretion	GO:0090188	3.0534371983194537e-06	3	5	16	WNK1,WNK3,WNK4	0.1666666666666666	0.1875	ANKRD39 BTBD9 KCTD9 KCTD11 KLHL2 KLHL3 KLHL12 KLHL22 KLHL25 RHOBTB2 RHOBTB3 SHKBP1	12.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the regulation of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, either as substrate adaptors, regulators, or through indirect modulation.
