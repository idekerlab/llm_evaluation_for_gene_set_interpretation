MST1R, also known as the Macrophage Stimulating 1 Receptor or RON tyrosine kinase receptor, is primarily involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as growth, survival, and differentiation. It is activated by its ligand, Macrophage Stimulating Protein (MSP), and is implicated in wound healing, immune responses, and potentially in the invasive growth of cancer cells. MST1R signaling can lead to the activation of various pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, and the JAK/STAT pathway, which are critical for cell proliferation and survival.

2. PRPF31 is a component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA. It is involved in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing, which is a crucial process for the generation of mature, translatable mRNA molecules. Mutations in PRPF31 are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, indicating its importance in the maintenance of retinal cell function.

3. SUB1, also known as PC4, is a multifunctional protein that has roles in transcriptional coactivation, DNA repair, and the regulation of transcriptional elongation. It binds to single-stranded DNA and interacts with RNA polymerase II, influencing the transcription of specific genes. SUB1 is also implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage and is involved in maintaining genome stability.

To summarize, the proteins MST1R, PRPF31, and SUB1 are involved in distinct biological processes: MST1R in cell signaling and growth regulation, PRPF31 in mRNA processing, and SUB1 in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. There is no clear evidence of a shared biological process or pathway that prominently involves all three proteins. Therefore, they appear to represent a system of unrelated proteins with respect to their primary biological functions."	0.0	promoter clearance during DNA-templated transcription	GO:0001109	0.042027193116566	1	3	3	SUB1	0.2	0.3333333333333333											False	True

The HOX family of proteins, including HOXA1 through HOXA6, HOXA11, HOXB2 through HOXB9, and HOXD3 through HOXD11, are transcription factors that play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. They are known for their involvement in patterning the anterior-posterior axis and specifying regional identity in the developing embryo.

2. The HOXA cluster proteins, such as HOXA1 and HOXA2, are essential for the proper development of the hindbrain and branchial arches. They are also implicated in the differentiation of various cell types and organs, including the limbs, gut, and reproductive system.

3. Similarly, the HOXB cluster proteins, including HOXB2 through HOXB9, are involved in the development of the axial skeleton, limbs, and genitourinary system. They contribute to the segmental organization of the embryo and are crucial for the formation of the vertebral column and thoracic cage.

4. The HOXD cluster proteins, such as HOXD3 through HOXD11, are particularly important for limb development, including the patterning of digits and the establishment of limb identity. They also play roles in the development of the urogenital system and the gastrointestinal tract.

5. The coordinated expression of HOX proteins is tightly regulated and involves complex interactions with other transcription factors, cofactors, and epigenetic modifiers. These interactions ensure the precise spatial and temporal expression patterns required for normal development.

6. The HOX proteins often function in a combinatorial manner, with multiple HOX proteins binding to DNA regulatory elements to control the expression of target genes. This combinatorial code contributes to the diversity of developmental outcomes and the specificity of tissue patterning.

To summarize, the HOX proteins in this system are central to the regulation of developmental gene expression. They are involved in the specification of body plan and the differentiation of structures along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. The system of interacting proteins functions in a highly coordinated and integrated manner to control the expression of genes critical for proper embryonic development."	0.98	embryonic skeletal system development	GO:0048706	2.3446415282655603e-35	18	128	21	HOXA2,HOXA3,HOXA4,HOXA5,HOXA6,HOXA11,HOXB2,HOXB3,HOXB4,HOXB5,HOXB6,HOXB7,HOXB8,HOXB9,HOXD3,HOXD4,HOXD9,HOXD10	0.13740458015267176	0.8571428571428571	HOXA1 HOXA2 HOXA3 HOXA4 HOXA5 HOXA6 HOXA11 HOXB2 HOXB3 HOXB4 HOXB5 HOXB6 HOXB7 HOXB8 HOXB9 HOXD3 HOXD4 HOXD8 HOXD9 HOXD10 HOXD11	21.0	"-- Summary --||The provided text describes the HOX family of proteins, including specific HOXA, HOXB, and HOXD cluster genes, as transcription factors crucial for regulating gene expression during embryonic development.

ARSA (arylsulfatase A) is involved in the degradation of sulfatides in lysosomes. Deficiency in ARSA activity leads to a lysosomal storage disorder known as metachromatic leukodystrophy, which affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system.

2. CNP (2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase) is an enzyme highly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the production of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides. It plays a role in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath.

3. GALNS (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase) is another lysosomal enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans, specifically keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Deficiencies in GALNS activity result in Morquio A syndrome, a type of mucopolysaccharidosis.

4. MYL7 (myosin light chain 7) is a cardiac-specific myosin light chain that is part of the contractile apparatus of cardiac muscle cells. It plays a role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction.

5. SMARCB1 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1) is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. It is involved in transcriptional regulation and is implicated in tumor suppression.

6. UACA (uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats) is a protein with less well-characterized functions, but it is thought to be involved in apoptosis and may play a role in autoimmune uveitis.

The proteins listed are involved in a variety of biological processes, including lysosomal degradation, myelin sheath maintenance, cardiac muscle contraction, chromatin remodeling, and potentially apoptosis and immune response. There is no single, prominent biological process that encompasses the functions of all these proteins. Instead, they participate in distinct and separate pathways within the cell. The interactions between these proteins, if any, do not suggest a unified biological process.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, overarching biological process, the proteins in this system appear to be involved in unrelated pathways. Therefore, the most appropriate name for the biological process performed by this system is:

Process: System of unrelated proteins (0.00)"	0.25	growth of unicellular organism as a thread of attached cells	GO:0070783	0.0076626810971341	1	1	5	SMARCB1	0.2	0.2	ARSA CNP GALNS MYL7 SMARCB1	5.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Diverse Cellular Functions and Pathways"" because they are involved in distinct and unrelated biological processes, such as lysosomal degradation, myelin sheath maintenance, cardiac muscle contraction, chromatin remodeling, and potentially apoptosis and immune response. This diversity aligns with the suggested name.||||-- Explanation --||ARSA: High||ARSA is involved in lysosomal degradation of sulfatides, a distinct function that supports the diversity of cellular functions.||||CNP: High||CNP is involved in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath, a specific function that contributes to the diversity of cellular pathways.||||GALNS: High||GALNS is involved in lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans, another distinct function that supports the diversity of cellular functions.||||MYL7: High||MYL7 is involved in cardiac muscle contraction, a specific and unrelated function that contributes to the diversity of cellular pathways.||||SMARCB1: High||SMARCB1 is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, a distinct function that supports the diversity of cellular functions.||||UACA: Medium||UACA is thought to be involved in apoptosis and potentially autoimmune uveitis, which are less well-characterized but still distinct functions contributing to the diversity of cellular pathways.||||-- genes supporting the name: ARSA, CNP, GALNS, MYL7, SMARCB1, UACA||-- genes supporting the name with confidence = High:

The proteins AMPH, CPLX2, SNAP25, SNAP91, STX1B, SYN1, SYN2, SYP, SYT1, and SYT5 are all integral to synaptic transmission. They are involved in the docking, priming, and fusion of synaptic vesicles, as well as the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These proteins work in concert to ensure rapid and precise communication between neurons.

2. Proteins such as MAP2, MAPRE3, MAPT, and DCX are associated with microtubule stabilization and dynamics, which are crucial for neuronal structure, axonal transport, and the establishment of neuronal polarity during development and regeneration.

3. CAMKV, CNTN1, DCLK1, DPYSL5, EDIL3, GRIA2, HPCA, HPCAL1, L1CAM, LSAMP, NCALD, and VSNL1 are involved in neuronal signaling and plasticity. They participate in processes such as neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and calcium signaling, which are essential for learning, memory, and the overall function of neural networks.

4. CALB2, GNG2, and SNCB are calcium-binding proteins that regulate intracellular calcium levels, a key second messenger in various neuronal processes, including neurotransmitter release and gene expression.

5. ATP4A is a component of the proton pump responsible for acidifying the stomach. Its inclusion in this system may indicate a peripheral connection to neuronal control of gastric functions or may be an unrelated function.

6. DNAAF2 is known for its role in ciliary function and may be involved in the development of neuronal cilia or could be an outlier in this protein system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the development, structure, and function of neurons, particularly in the context of synaptic transmission and plasticity. The system reflects a complex network of proteins that work together to ensure proper neuronal communication, learning, and memory. The presence of a few proteins with less clear connections to neuronal function suggests additional peripheral roles or a minor degree of unrelated functions within the system."	0.95	vesicle-mediated transport in synapse	GO:0099003	1.973000355359184e-14	13	223	35	AMPH,CPLX2,ERC2,HPCA,SNAP25,SNAP91,SNCB,STX1B,SYN1,SYN2,SYP,SYT1,SYT5	0.053061224489795916	0.37142857142857144	AMPH CPLX2 SNAP25 SNAP91 STX1B SYN1 SYN2 SYP SYT1 SYT5 MAP2 MAPRE3 MAPT DCX CAMKV CNTN1 DCLK1 DPYSL5 EDIL3 GRIA2 HPCA HPCAL1 L1CAM LSAMP NCALD VSNL1 CALB2 GNG2 SNCB	29.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided list are definitively associated with neuronal development and synaptic function.

Here is a brief analysis of the functional diversity within this system:

1. Several proteins in the list are involved in metabolic processes, but they do not share a common metabolic pathway. For example, MTHFR is involved in folate metabolism and homocysteine remethylation, while NUDT18 is a hydrolase that may play a role in the uridine and deoxycytidine salvage pathways.

2. Some proteins are implicated in cellular transport mechanisms, such as SLC2A6 and SLC43A2, which are solute carriers for different substrates, but they do not appear to be part of a coordinated transport system.

3. A few proteins have roles in the immune response, such as IFNG, which is a critical cytokine in innate and adaptive immunity, and TNFAIP2, which is involved in the inflammatory response. However, these proteins do not represent a unified aspect of immune function.

4. Proteins like MYBPC3 are involved in structural components of muscle tissue, while others like MATN1 and MATN4 are involved in extracellular matrix organization, indicating a diversity in structural and organizational roles.

5. There are also proteins with roles in signal transduction, such as SEMA4A, which is a semaphorin involved in axonal guidance, and RGL1, which is a Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator, but these do not form a coherent signaling pathway.

6. TP53I11 is related to the p53 signaling pathway, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, but it is not part of a larger, identifiable process within this protein system.

7. Other proteins have very specific and unique functions, such as OPRL1, which is an opioid receptor, and VOPP1, which is implicated in vesicular trafficking.

Given the lack of a unifying theme or biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins, it is appropriate to conclude that this system represents a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that no single prominent biological process can be ascribed to this group of proteins."	0.0	negative regulation of adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway	GO:0106072	0.0471440486180662	2	10	29	MRAP2,OPRL1	0.05405405405405406	0.06896551724137931											False	True

MGMT, also known as O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, is involved in the direct repair of alkylated DNA. It removes mutagenic and cytotoxic adducts from the O-6 position of guanine, thereby preventing erroneous base pairing and mutations.

2. MUTYH is a base excision repair enzyme that recognizes and excises oxidatively damaged DNA bases like 8-oxoguanine, which can mispair with adenine, leading to mutations during replication if left unrepaired.

3. TDP1, or tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, functions in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks containing a 3'-end blocking lesion and is particularly important for the resolution of topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes.

4. SLX4IP interacts with SLX4, a structure-specific endonuclease subunit, which is involved in the repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks and in the maintenance of telomeres in association with the telomere maintenance complex.

5. HUS1B is a component of the 9-1-1 cell cycle checkpoint response complex that plays a critical role in DNA damage response and repair as well as maintaining genomic stability.

6. HPRT1, or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1, while primarily known for its role in the purine salvage pathway, also has a role in maintaining genomic integrity by participating in DNA repair.

7. PARN, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease, is involved in the control of mRNA stability and has been implicated in the regulation of DNA repair mRNA transcripts, influencing the DNA damage response.

8. RRAD, Ras-related associated with diabetes, is a small GTPase that may be involved in the cellular stress response, although its role in DNA repair is not well characterized.

9. SAPCD1 (suppressor APC domain containing 1), DOCK9 (dedicator of cytokinesis 9), C10orf88 (chromosome 10 open reading frame 88), THUMPD1 (THUMP domain containing 1), WDCP (WD repeat and coiled-coil containing), and ZBTB14 (zinc finger and BTB domain containing 14) are proteins with less clearly defined roles in DNA repair or genomic stability, but they may contribute to these processes through indirect mechanisms or as part of larger protein complexes.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly or indirectly involved in the recognition, signaling, and repair of DNA damage, as well as the maintenance of genomic stability. The interplay between these proteins ensures the integrity of the genome is preserved, preventing mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer. The presence of several key DNA repair enzymes and associated factors suggests a coordinated network focused on safeguarding the cell's genetic information."	0.85	guanine salvage	GO:0006178	0.0427917192245845	1	1	11	HPRT1	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	MGMT MUTYH TDP1 SLX4IP HUS1B	5.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are directly involved in DNA repair mechanisms or the maintenance of genomic stability.

2. CBLN2 is involved in synapse integrity and neuronal communication, while proteins like KCNJ13, KCNK5, and KCNT2 are potassium channels with roles in maintaining the membrane potential and regulating neuronal excitability.

3. GH1 (Growth Hormone 1) plays a critical role in growth, metabolism, and development, whereas GREM2 (Gremlin 2) is involved in developmental processes and antagonizes bone morphogenetic proteins.

4. GRPR (Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor) is a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including cell signaling in the gastrointestinal tract.

5. Proteins like MEGF9 and PCDH8 (Protocadherin 8) are implicated in cell adhesion and signaling, which are essential for tissue organization and integrity.

6. Enzymes such as PPIP5K1 (Diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase 1) are involved in inositol phosphate metabolism, which is important for cellular signaling pathways.

7. SLC26A7 and SLCO3A1 are transporters that facilitate the movement of anions and organic compounds across cell membranes, respectively, indicating roles in ion homeostasis and substrate transport.

8. ST6GALNAC2 and ST6GALNAC4 are sialyltransferases that modify glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing cell-cell interactions and signaling.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, overarching biological process that is prominently represented by the majority of the proteins in the list, it is appropriate to conclude that this is a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00. This indicates that there is no single biological process that can be confidently named based on the provided protein system."	0.0	cell proliferation involved in embryonic placenta development	GO:0060722	0.0014930551952084	2	2	38	IGF2,PHLDA2	0.05263157894736842	0.05263157894736842											False	True

GYG1 and GYG2 are glycogenin proteins that serve as the core upon which glycogen synthase (GYS1) can begin glycogen synthesis. GYG1 and GYG2 are involved in the autoglucosylation that initiates glycogen granule formation, while GYS1 extends the glycogen molecule by adding glucose units.

2. PPP1R3C, PPP1R10, PPP1R11, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, and PPP1R37 are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1 is a major enzyme that dephosphorylates glycogen synthase, activating it for glycogen synthesis, and glycogen phosphorylase, inactivating it to stop glycogen breakdown. These regulatory subunits target PP1 to specific subcellular locations and modulate its activity towards specific substrates, including those involved in glycogen metabolism.

3. UGP2 encodes for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2, an enzyme that produces UDP-glucose, a direct precursor for glycogen synthesis. This links the protein to glycogen metabolism as well.

4. AATK, LMTK2, SH3RF2, and SHOC2 are involved in signal transduction pathways that can influence cell survival, apoptosis, and possibly metabolic processes, although their direct roles in glycogen metabolism are not as clear as the other proteins mentioned.

5. CLOCK is a core component of the circadian clock, which regulates rhythms in physiology and behavior, including glucose metabolism. It forms a heterodimer with BMAL1 and regulates the transcription of various clock-controlled genes.

6. CIPC, TOX4, and ZFYVE16 are associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms and may indirectly influence metabolic processes through the modulation of circadian-controlled genes.

7. CNST, CSRNP1, PEAK1, PHACTR1, PHACTR3, PPP1R10, TPRN, and ZFYVE9 are proteins with diverse functions, including roles in cytoskeletal organization, RNA splicing, and signal transduction. Their direct involvement in glycogen metabolism or circadian regulation is not well established based on current knowledge.

To summarize, a significant number of proteins in this system are directly involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, with a subset also linked to the circadian regulation of metabolic processes. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated regulation of glucose homeostasis that is influenced by the circadian clock, which could have implications for understanding diseases such as diabetes where both glycogen metabolism and circadian rhythms are disrupted. The confidence score reflects the strong but not exclusive representation of these processes within the system."	0.85	glucan biosynthetic process	GO:0009250	5.366670898718067e-07	5	45	24	GYG1,GYG2,GYS1,PPP1R3C,UGP2	0.078125	0.20833333333333334	GYG1 GYG2 GYS1 PPP1R3C PPP1R10 PPP1R11 PPP1R13L PPP1R15A PPP1R37 UGP2 CLOCK	11.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Glycogen Metabolism and Circadian Regulation of Glucose Homeostasis"" due to the clear involvement of several genes in glycogen metabolism and the regulation of circadian rhythms, which are crucial for glucose homeostasis.||||-- Explanation --||GYG1: High||GYG1 is directly involved in the initiation of glycogen granule formation through autoglucosylation, supporting glycogen metabolism.||||GYG2: High||GYG2, like GYG1, is involved in the autoglucosylation that initiates glycogen granule formation, supporting glycogen metabolism.||||GYS1: High||GYS1 extends the glycogen molecule by adding glucose units, directly supporting glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R3C: High||PPP1R3C is a regulatory subunit of PP1, which dephosphorylates and activates glycogen synthase, supporting glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R10: High||PPP1R10 is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R11: High||PPP1R11 is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R13L: High||PPP1R13L is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R15A: High||PPP1R15A is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R37: High||PPP1R37 is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||UGP2: High||UGP2 produces UDP-glucose, a direct precursor for glycogen synthesis, supporting glycogen metabolism.||||CLOCK: High||CLOCK is a core component of the circadian clock, regulating rhythms in physiology and behavior, including glucose metabolism.||||CIPC: Medium||CIPC is associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms, which may influence metabolic processes.||||TOX4: Medium||TOX4 is associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms, which may influence metabolic processes.||||ZFYVE16: Medium||ZFYVE16 is associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms, which may influence metabolic processes.||||-- genes supporting the name: GYG1, GYG2, GYS1, PPP1R3C, PPP1R10, PPP1R11, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, PPP1R37, UGP2, CLOCK, CIPC, TOX4, ZFYVE16||-- genes supporting the name with confidence = High: GYG1, GYG2, GYS1, PPP1R3C, PPP1R10, PPP1R11, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, PPP1R37, UGP2, CLOCK"	25.0	0.44	glucose homeostasis	GO:0042593	DBH GCG GCK ASPSCR1 PLSCR3 SGCB IGFBP5 FOXO3 OPRK1 TREM2 ADRA2A SESN3 PIK3R2 MPC2 MCU GPX1 SMARCB1 SLC39A14 PCK2 UBTF FFAR2 HNF4A UCP2 STX4 VSNL1 XBP1 WFS1 CEBPA KCNJ11 CDK16 NR1D1 ADIPOR2 GPER1 SLC30A8 ZBTB20 UNC13B CCN4 AKT1 GPR21 ACE PDX1 HLA-DRB1 ALOX5 MTNR1B NME1-NME2 SUCNR1 AGER PARK7 CPB2 SLC29A1 NUCKS1 CYP11B1 ADIPOQ CCDC186 NDUFAF2 CMKLR2 DHPS PDK2 HK2 CARTPT PRKACA PAX2 PPP3CA NPTX1 TRPM4 GCGR ENY2 HK3 LIN28A NME2 GPI SIRT1 TSC22D4 PFKM NR1H4 BHLHA15 FOXK1 G6PC1 PRKCE GATA4 NADK PTPRN2 LEP TRA2B PPP1R3G BAD FGFR4 NKX6-1 GPR27 DUSP29 LRP5 ZBED6 PDK4 TCF7L2 RPTOR PLA2G6 OAS1 CFTR C1QTNF12 SLC2A4 PTPN2 PIH1D1 HK1 INSR SLC12A6 IGF1R OGT CYB5R4 PTCH1 JAGN1 INPP5K MLXIPL PPARG PYGL SLC12A7 RPS6 RAB11FIP5 PTPN11 ANO1 SLC16A1 GPLD1 SIDT2 OSBP STXBP4 PPARGC1A RAB11B EFNA5 RAF1 KCNB1 ACSM2A KAT5 GCLC PAX6 NGFR FGF21 USF1 PIK3CA NCOA5 SOX4 FABP5 FOXO1 CMA1 IRS2 SRI ADCY8 VGF OBP2A GJB6 FOXA2 NOX4 RBP4 FKBP1B HNF1A NEUROD1 HKDC1 STAT3 DYNLL1 TH PCK1 TRPV4 ICAM1 EPHA5 RMI1 CASR STK11 RAB11FIP2 CNR1 IL6 INS FFAR1 ADISSP HIF1A ADCY5 TIAM1 LRRC8A RACK1 TWNK CRY2 PIM3 BGLAP SYBU CYP7A1 ABCA12 SRF SIN3A FOXA1 PIK3R1 ERN1 BAIAP3 FOXA3 PRKAA2 CLTRN POMC CSRP3 GPR68 RRAGA IRS1 SLC9B2 SIRT6 ADGRF5 CRH ADIPOR1 SLC8B1 GCLM MBD5 KLF7 CRTC2 NCF1 SERPINF1 GCKR ZNF236 CRY1 PRKAA1 APPL2 RBM4 BRSK2 RFX6 PTPRN LEPR G6PC2 C2CD2L SMARCA4 CAV3 BACE2 LRRC8D SLC2A2 GHRL CSMD1 GAS6 ABCC8 SESN2 FOXK2 KLF15 STXBP3 SMAD4 PRCP RPH3AL SELENOT PDE8B FOSL2 PPP3CB	241.0	0.0413533834586466	False	True

It is involved in p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis triggered by various stimuli, including DNA damage and growth factor deprivation. BBC3 acts by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, neutralizing their protective effect and thus promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is a critical step in apoptosis.

2. PMAIP1, known as NOXA, is another pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Similar to BBC3, it is implicated in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is regulated by p53. PMAIP1 preferentially binds to MCL1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and targets it for proteasomal degradation, thereby tipping the balance towards apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

3. CC2D1A is a transcriptional co-regulator that has been implicated in neural development and is known to interact with the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A. While its direct role in apoptosis is less clear compared to BBC3 and PMAIP1, it has been associated with signaling pathways that can influence cell survival and apoptosis indirectly.

The proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. BBC3 and PMAIP1 are direct effectors of apoptosis, promoting cell death in response to stress signals.

ATF1, ATF4, CREB1, and CREM are members of the Activating Transcription Factor (ATF)/cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB) protein family. These transcription factors can form homo- or heterodimers and bind to cAMP response elements (CRE) in DNA, regulating the transcription of genes in response to hormonal and stress signals. ATF4 is particularly known for its role in the cellular stress response, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), and amino acid metabolism.

2. BATF and JDP2 are basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. BATF forms dimers with Jun proteins and is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and differentiation of immune cells. JDP2 represses transcription by forming inactive complexes with other transcription factors and is implicated in cellular stress response mechanisms.

3. CEBPG (also known as C/EBP gamma) is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and functions as a transcriptional regulator involved in cell cycle and metabolism. It can act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of other C/EBP family members.

4. DDIT3 (also known as CHOP) is a transcription factor induced by cellular stress, particularly during the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. It is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and can heterodimerize with ATF4.

5. GABBR1 and GABBR2 encode the subunits of the GABA(B) receptor, which is involved in neurotransmission. While not directly related to transcriptional regulation, their interaction with the system could suggest a role in cellular signaling pathways that influence gene expression.

6. GOLGA1 (also known as golgin A1) is involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and may play a role in the trafficking of proteins that are crucial for transcriptional regulation.

7. JAKMIP1 (Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1) is associated with microtubules and may be involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene expression.

8. MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein) is a transcription factor that can bind to G/C-rich DNA sequences and is implicated in gene expression regulation and DNA repair.

9. POU6F1 (POU class 6 homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that may play a role in the development of the nervous system and in the regulation of gene expression.

10. UTF1 (Undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1) is associated with maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and may regulate gene expression during early development.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to cellular stress and developmental signals. They include transcription factors that respond to stress, regulate metabolism, and control developmental processes. The presence of GABA(B) receptor subunits suggests a potential link to signal transduction pathways that modulate the activity of these transcription factors. The system appears to be functionally integrated around the regulation of gene expression in response to various intracellular and extracellular stimuli, with a significant emphasis on the cellular stress response."	0.92	neuron-glial cell signaling	GO:0150099	0.0006218248366263	2	5	14	DDIT3,GABBR1	0.11764705882352941	0.14285714285714285	ATF1 ATF4 CREB1 CREM BATF JDP2 CEBPG DDIT3 MAZ POU6F1 UTF1	11.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the given name ""Cellular Stress Response and Gene Expression Regulation"" because they are predominantly involved in transcriptional regulation in response to cellular stress and developmental signals.

They are involved in various developmental processes, including cardiovascular development, neurogenesis, and somitogenesis. These factors can act as transcriptional repressors and are important for maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation.

3. NINL is a ciliary protein that has been associated with dynein motor regulation and may play a role in the organization of cellular structures during cell division and differentiation. Its interaction with other proteins in this system suggests a potential link to signaling pathways that govern developmental processes.

4. PAWR, also known as Par-4, is a pro-apoptotic protein that can interact with various signaling pathways, including those mediated by PKC and AKT. It is implicated in the regulation of cell survival and has been shown to play a role in neuronal differentiation and development.

5. SPRYD3 belongs to the SPRY domain-containing family of proteins that are modulators of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, which is crucial for various developmental and cellular processes. SPRYD3 may influence cell signaling cascades that are important for cell fate determination and differentiation.

6. THAP1 is a DNA-binding protein with a THAP domain, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control. Mutations in THAP1 have been associated with developmental disorders, suggesting its role in the regulation of gene expression during development.

In summary, the proteins in this set are involved in the regulation of transcription and cell signaling pathways that are critical for developmental processes. They exhibit a functional integration that influences cell fate determination, differentiation, and apoptosis, particularly in the context of neuronal and cardiovascular development. The interactions among these proteins suggest a coordinated network that modulates developmental signaling pathways, with potential antagonistic and synergistic effects on gene expression and cellular outcomes."	0.88	umbilical cord morphogenesis	GO:0036304	9.654475370495002e-06	2	2	7	HEY1,HEY2	0.2857142857142857	0.2857142857142857	FBXO45 HEY1 HEY2 HEYL PAWR THAP1	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Regulation of transcription and cell signaling in development"" as most genes are involved in transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, and developmental processes.

ADCK5 (AarF Domain Containing Kinase 5) is an atypical member of the protein kinase family and is poorly characterized in terms of its biological function. It does not seem to have a clear role in any specific metabolic or signaling pathway based on current knowledge.

2. CYHR1 (Cysteine And Histidine Rich 1) is a protein that contains a high number of cysteine and histidine residues, suggesting a potential role in binding metal ions or redox reactions. However, its precise biological role remains unclear, and it does not appear to be directly connected to the functions of the other proteins listed.

3. DGAT1 (Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis. It is involved in lipid metabolism and energy storage. DGAT1's activity is crucial for the formation of adipose tissue and the storage of dietary fats.

4. MROH1 (Maestro Heat-Like Repeat Family Member 1) is a protein with unknown function. It contains a Maestro domain, which is typically involved in lipid binding, but the specific biological processes it influences are not well-defined.

5. PYCRL (Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Reductase-Like) is involved in the proline biosynthesis pathway, converting pyrroline-5-carboxylate to proline. This enzyme plays a role in amino acid metabolism and the cellular stress response.

6. TMEM249 (Transmembrane Protein 249) is a protein with no well-characterized function. It is a transmembrane protein, suggesting a potential role in cellular transport or signaling, but its specific contributions to biological processes are not established.

In summary, the proteins listed do not show a coherent pattern of interaction or participation in a common biological process based on the available information. They are involved in disparate functions such as lipid metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and potentially metal ion binding or transport, but there is no evidence to suggest they form a functional system. Therefore, the most appropriate designation for this group of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the lack of a prominent biological process that they collectively perform."	0.0	L-proline biosynthetic process	GO:0055129	0.036491480799297	1	7	3	MROH1	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333											False	True

RNMT, the RNA (guanine-7-) methyltransferase, is involved in mRNA cap methylation, which is crucial for mRNA stability and efficient translation, processes that are particularly important under stress conditions where protein synthesis needs to be tightly regulated.

2. SAMD9L, the sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein, has been implicated in the innate immune response and may also play a role in cellular stress responses, potentially by regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis.

3. CEBPB and CEBPG are members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family and function as transcription factors that regulate genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, as well as in cellular metabolism, particularly under stress conditions.

4. PSMD12, a component of the 19S proteasome, is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process that is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, especially during cellular stress when damaged proteins accumulate.

5. RSRC2 and HNRNPA1 are RNA-binding proteins that influence RNA splicing and stability, which are critical for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during stress responses.

6. XBP1 is a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to restore normal function by enhancing the production of molecular chaperones and components of the protein degradation machinery.

7. GADD45A is involved in the response to environmental stress and DNA damage, and it plays a role in growth arrest and apoptosis, which are important for cellular recovery and adaptation to stress.

8. USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can regulate the stability of proteins involved in the DNA damage response and may also influence other stress response pathways.

9. HIAT1, MSANTD3, NDFIP1, WRB, KLHL36, EIF2A, CALML4, GCLM, KDM5B, GNA12, ZNF655, and METTL21B are proteins with various functions, including neurotransmitter transport (HIAT1), regulation of gene expression (MSANTD3, KDM5B, ZNF655), protein translation initiation (EIF2A), calcium signaling (CALML4), redox homeostasis (GCLM), and protein methylation (METTL21B). These proteins may contribute to the overall cellular response to stress by modulating specific pathways or cellular processes.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a coordinated response to cellular stress, which includes the regulation of gene expression, mRNA processing, protein synthesis, and degradation, as well as DNA repair and cell cycle control. The system reflects a multifaceted approach to maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity under stress conditions, with a significant proportion of the proteins directly participating in stress response pathways."	0.85	hepatocyte proliferation	GO:0072574	0.0163492276917296	2	24	18	CEBPB,XBP1	0.05	0.1111111111111111	RNMT CEBPB CEBPG PSMD12 XBP1 GADD45A	6.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Protein Homeostasis"" as they are involved in various processes critical for managing cellular stress, including mRNA processing, protein synthesis and degradation, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression.

TSPY3, testis-specific protein Y-linked 3, is a protein that is thought to be involved in spermatogenesis, a process specific to testicular function.

2. LGALS14, galectin-14, is a member of the galectin family, which are beta-galactoside-binding proteins implicated in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.

3. PPBPP2, prostatic and brain phosphatase-associated protein 2, has limited information available and its biological process is not well-characterized.

4. LARS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, is an enzyme that links leucine to its corresponding tRNA, playing a role in protein synthesis.

5. MRPS10, mitochondrial ribosomal protein S10, is part of the mitochondrial ribosome and is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis.

6. PAX9, paired box 9, is a transcription factor involved in craniofacial development and tooth morphogenesis.

7. RBM22, RNA binding motif protein 22, is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and is a component of the spliceosome.

8. LOC100131150, a locus with no well-defined protein product, cannot be characterized in terms of biological process without further information.

9. SLITRK4, SLIT and NTRK-like family member 4, is a member of a family of proteins that are thought to be involved in neurite outgrowth and may play a role in the nervous system.

10. ATRX, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, is involved in chromatin remodeling and is implicated in hematopoiesis and brain development.

11. GOLGA2 and GOLGA1, golgin A2 and golgin A1, are involved in the Golgi apparatus structure and function.

12. LCA5L, lebercilin-like, is related to Leber congenital amaurosis, a retinal dystrophy, and is thought to be involved in ciliogenesis.

13. C7ORF49, chromosome 7 open reading frame 49, has an unclear function and is not well-characterized.

14. OPN1LW, opsin 1 (cone pigments), long-wave-sensitive, is a photopigment found in the retina and is involved in color vision.

15. LOC645984, similar to LOC100131150, is a locus with no well-defined protein product and its biological process is not well-characterized.

The proteins listed do not show a coherent or predominant biological process that they collectively contribute to. They are involved in a diverse array of functions, including but not limited to spermatogenesis, cell-cell interactions, protein synthesis, craniofacial development, pre-mRNA splicing, neurite outgrowth, chromatin remodeling, Golgi apparatus function, ciliogenesis, and vision. The lack of a unifying theme or process among these proteins leads to the conclusion that this is a system of unrelated proteins."	0.0	meiotic spindle organization	GO:0000212	0.0236165784271766	2	19	11	RBM22,LOC100131150	0.07142857142857142	0.18181818181818182											False	True
