CEP41 is a centrosomal protein that plays a role in microtubule organization. It is implicated in ciliogenesis and may be involved in the Joubert syndrome, a disorder affecting the development of the cerebellum and brainstem.

2. DPP4, also known as CD26, is a serine exopeptidase that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. It is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism by inactivating incretins like GLP-1, and it also plays a role in immune regulation.

3. IQCG is associated with the regulation of the calcium channel activity in sperm. It is involved in sperm motility and may play a role in male fertility.

4. ITSN1 is an adaptor protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular signaling. It has a role in synaptic vesicle cycling and may influence neurotransmitter release.

5. NFATC4, or Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 4, is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to signals that increase intracellular calcium. It plays a role in the immune response and cardiac hypertrophy.

6. PDP1, Pyruvate dehyrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 1, is involved in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle.

7. PIP5K1C synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a precursor of secondary messengers involved in signaling pathways, including those regulating cell growth, shape, and motility.

8. PLCD1 encodes phospholipase C delta 1, which hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), involved in calcium signaling and protein kinase C activation.

9. RCAN3 is part of the regulators of calcineurin (RCAN) family and modulates calcineurin signaling. It is implicated in the negative feedback of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway.

10. SLU7 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and is essential for the generation of proper 3' splice site selection.

11. TRPV6 is a member of the transient receptor potential cation channel family and is involved in calcium absorption in the intestine and kidney.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling and ion homeostasis. CEP41, ITSN1, PIP5K1C, PLCD1, and NFATC4 are all involved in different aspects of cellular signaling pathways, with a focus on calcium signaling and its downstream effects, including gene expression and neurotransmitter release. DPP4 has a role in glucose metabolism and immune regulation. IQCG and TRPV6 are involved in calcium channel activity and homeostasis, with implications for fertility and mineral absorption, respectively. PDP1 connects metabolic pathways by regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. RCAN3 and SLU7, while not directly involved in signaling, modulate signaling pathways and RNA processing, respectively, which can indirectly affect cellular responses to signals. The interplay of these proteins suggests a system that is primarily engaged in the regulation of intracellular signaling cascades and the maintenance of ion homeostasis, particularly calcium."	0.85	presynaptic endocytosis	GO:0140238	0.0632833425369177	2	73	11	ITSN1,PIP5K1C	0.024390243902439025	0.18181818181818182	CEP41 ITSN1 NFATC4 PIP5K1C PLCD1 RCAN3 TRPV6	7.0	-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly involves proteins that play roles in intracellular signaling and ion homeostasis, particularly calcium signaling.

MAMDC4, ME3, MUM1, NIPSNAP3B, POMGNT1, POTEM, PPP1R3E, PRR22, RSPO2, SLC25A45, SYCE1L, and TMEM116 represent a diverse group of proteins with functions ranging from enzyme activity (ME3), glycosylation (POMGNT1), protein-protein interactions (MUM1), and transport across membranes (SLC25A45). These proteins may contribute to various cellular processes, including metabolism, protein modification, and cellular structure maintenance.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in two main biological processes: chromatin organization, which is critical for the regulation of gene expression, and mitochondrial function, which is essential for energy production and metabolic homeostasis. The histone proteins play a central role in chromatin dynamics, while IMMP1L and IMMP2L are key for mitochondrial protein processing. The other proteins, although functionally diverse, may contribute to these processes or related cellular activities. The name ""Chromatin Organization and Mitochondrial Function Regulation"" reflects the involvement of a significant proportion of the genes in chromatin-related processes and mitochondrial function, with a high confidence score due to the clear roles of the histones and mitochondrial peptidases. However, the presence of other proteins with less clearly defined roles in these processes warrants a slightly reduced confidence score."	0.85	protein processing involved in protein targeting to mitochondrion	GO:0006627	0.0028117898730985	2	7	14	H2AC13,H4C1	0.10526315789473684	0.14285714285714285	HIST1H2AB HIST1H2AI HIST1H4A HIST1H4K IMMP1L IMMP2L	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set ""Chromatin Organization and Mitochondrial Function Regulation"" is supported by several genes with clear roles in chromatin dynamics and mitochondrial function.

Several proteins in this system, such as STAT1, MYD88, OAS3, DHX58, and MX1, are key components of the immune response, particularly in the context of viral defense mechanisms. STAT1 is a critical transcription factor in the interferon signaling pathway, which is activated in response to viral infections. MYD88 is an adaptor protein that plays a central role in the innate immune response to pathogens. OAS3, DHX58 (also known as LGP2), and MX1 are involved in recognizing viral RNA and mediating antiviral responses.

2. Proteins like CFLAR, CASP4, BCL2L13, and MCL1 are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. CFLAR (also known as c-FLIP) is an inhibitor of death receptor signaling, which can prevent apoptosis. CASP4 is a caspase that can initiate inflammatory forms of cell death. BCL2L13 and MCL1 are members of the Bcl-2 family, which are key regulators of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

3. The presence of HLA-G, a non-classical MHC class I molecule, suggests a role in immune tolerance, particularly during pregnancy, where it contributes to the protection of the fetus from the maternal immune system.

4. Proteins such as NFKB2 and TRIM21 are involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, which is a central pathway in the immune response, inflammation, and cell survival.

5. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is represented by proteins like USP14, USP18, and UBA6, which are involved in protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes, including the immune response.

6. Proteins like NLRC5 and BATF2 are also associated with immune functions. NLRC5 is involved in the regulation of MHC class I genes, and BATF2 is a transcription factor that can be induced by interferons.

7. The system includes several proteins with roles in RNA processing and regulation, such as PNPT1, which is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing, and RBMS2, which is involved in mRNA stabilization.

8. Proteins like GALNT7 and MOCOS are involved in post-translational modifications and enzyme cofactor biosynthesis, respectively, which can indirectly affect various biological processes, including immune responses.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and homeostasis in the face of pathogenic challenge. The system also includes proteins that contribute to immune tolerance and the regulation of inflammation. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to infection and cellular stress, with mechanisms in place to regulate cell death and survival."	0.85	defense response to virus	GO:0051607	6.751249416623267e-08	13	312	71	TRIM21,USP18,OAS3,DHX58,STAT1,ZC3HAV1,NLRC5,MYD88,DTX3L,IFI44L,MX1,DDX60L,IFIT5	0.03513513513513514	0.18309859154929578	STAT1 MYD88 OAS3 DHX58 MX1 CFLAR CASP4 BCL2L13 MCL1 HLA-G NFKB2 TRIM21 USP14 USP18 UBA6 NLRC5 BATF2	17.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Immune Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" due to their definitive roles in antiviral defense, immune signaling, and apoptosis regulation as described in the text.

WDR16, or WD repeat domain 16, is a protein that is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and may play a role in autophagy. The specific functions of WDR16 are not well-characterized, but given its domain structure, it is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate signal transduction pathways or assembly of protein complexes.

2. GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to internal signaling pathways. The gamma subunit, along with the beta subunit, forms a complex that interacts with the alpha subunit and receptors. GNG12 is implicated in the modulation of various signaling cascades, including those that regulate cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and possibly angiogenesis.

3. NSMAF, also known as neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activation associated factor, is involved in the ceramide signaling pathway. Ceramide is a lipid molecule that acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling cascades, particularly those related to stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis. NSMAF is thought to be involved in the activation of N-SMase, which leads to the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling. WDR16 may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes or pathways, GNG12 is directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and NSMAF is associated with lipid signaling pathways. While the specific interactions between these proteins are not well-defined, their collective involvement in signaling suggests a role in modulating intracellular communication and response to external stimuli. The confidence score reflects the fact that while each protein is involved in signaling, the direct connections and integration of their functions within a single, prominent biological process are not fully established."	0.75	establishment of left/right asymmetry	GO:0061966	0.0539050205810023	1	7	3	CFAP52	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	GNG12 NSMAF	2.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set ""Intracellular Signaling Modulation"" is supported by the functions of WDR16, GNG12, and NSMAF.
