The proteins in this system exhibit a diverse range of functions, but a significant number are involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation. This includes proteins that participate in the cellular response to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and other forms of cellular injury.

2. TP53, a well-known tumor suppressor, plays a pivotal role in the response to DNA damage and other cellular stresses. It can induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis depending on the context and extent of damage.

3. CASP2 (caspase-2) and BIK (Bcl-2-interacting killer) are pro-apoptotic proteins that contribute to the initiation and execution phases of apoptosis. CASP2 is involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BIK is a member of the Bcl-2 family that can induce apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

4. Proteins such as HSPA1A (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 1A) and GLUL (glutamate-ammonia ligase) are involved in the cellular stress response. HSPA1A acts as a molecular chaperone, helping to refold proteins and prevent aggregation under stress conditions, while GLUL is implicated in nitrogen metabolism and can be upregulated in response to metabolic stress.

5. Antioxidant enzymes like GPX3 (glutathione peroxidase 3) protect cells from oxidative damage by reducing peroxides, which can be a source of cellular stress.

6. Several proteins in this system, such as CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and FOSL1 (FOS-like antigen 1), are involved in cell cycle regulation and can influence the cellular response to stress by halting cell cycle progression to allow for repair or to initiate apoptosis.

7. The presence of proteins like ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) and MMP7 (matrix metallopeptidase 7) indicates a role in extracellular matrix remodeling, which can be associated with tissue repair following injury or stress.

8. TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) is a component of the innate immune system and can trigger inflammatory responses to cellular damage or the presence of pathogens.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into pathways that detect and respond to cellular stress and damage. They work in concert to regulate apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and control cell cycle progression in response to various stress signals. The system's prominent biological process is the coordination of cellular stress responses and the regulation of apoptosis, which is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the propagation of damaged cells."	0.85	regulation of multicellular organismal process	GO:0051239	0.0001152947250975	29	2955	72	1060P11.3,ADAM17,CCL18,CD58,CPT1A,CST3,CTNNB1,FTH1,HNRNPL,KLF4,MAFF,NUTF2,GUSBP14,TFF3,TLR4,TMEM176B,TNFAIP6,TP53,BTG3,CDKN2A,CYP1B1,GABRP,GPM6B,HEBP1,HSPA1A,MMP7,PLA2G4A,SERPINA5,TFPI2	cellular stress response  and  apoptosis regulation	multicellular organismal process	0.3833459	0.009673115410273516	0.4027777777777778	TP53 CASP2 BIK HSPA1A GPX3 CDKN2A TLR4	7.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Apoptosis Regulation"" because they are explicitly involved in pathways that detect and respond to cellular stress, regulate apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and control cell cycle progression.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of cholesterol and lipids. They participate in the mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and desaturation, and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. The system reflects a coordinated network that ensures the synthesis, uptake, and regulation of lipids and cholesterol, which are vital for membrane structure, energy storage, and signaling molecules."	0.85	sterol biosynthetic process	GO:0016126	7.01113695998352e-16	12	61	64	1060P11.3,CYP1B1,DDIT4,DHCR24,FCER1A,HERPUD1,HMGCR,HTATIP2,IDI1,ME1,RASA4,NHERF1	cholesterol biosynthesis  and  lipid metabolism regulation	sterol biosynthetic process	0.59675735	0.10619469026548672	0.1875	HMGCR HMGCS1 FDFT1 DHCR24 DHCR7 MSMO1 SC5D SQLE INSIG1 LDLR ACLY ELOVL5 FADS1 SCD SLC27A2 IDI1	16.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the given name ""Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Lipid Metabolism Regulation"" because they are directly involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, and homeostasis of cholesterol and lipids.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.

2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.

3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.

4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.

5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.

6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.

7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses."	0.88	response to stimulus	GO:0050896	1.3776806645839302e-07	58	8976	72	1060P11.3,ACKR1,ATP6V1D,AXIN1,BCL6,BEX1,CCNG2,CHRDL1,DDIT4,DUSP4,ENAH,FABP4,NIBAN1,FASN,FLNA,FOXO3,G6PD,ADGRG6,ADGRG2,INSIG1,JUND,KDM4B,LPP,MT1X,MTA1,MYC,NAMPT,PHLDA1,PIP5K1B,PROM1,PRR7,RHOB,RND3,RRAGD,S100A14,SCD,SERPINA3,SERPINB2,SFRP1,STC2,TIPARP,TRIB3,TSC22D3,UGDH,C8ORF33,CCNE2,COL10A1,COL11A1,CPS1,DKK3,DNAJA1,EFNB2,HNRNPA0,HSPA1A,MAF,NID2,SESN1,SFPQ	cellular stress response  and  metabolic regulation	response to stimulus	0.45727575	0.0064516129032258064	0.8055555555555556	DDIT4 DNAJA1 HSPA1A ATF5 ASNS FASN G6PD SCD BCL6 FOXO3 MYC NFIL3 LDLR INSIG1	14.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation"" due to their definitive roles in cellular stress response mechanisms, metabolic processes, and gene expression control related to these functions.

1. Several proteins like HOXB6 (a homeobox protein), NFIB (a transcription factor), and MAFF (a basic leucine zipper transcription factor) are involved in gene expression regulation but do not share a common pathway or target genes.

2. Proteins such as AGR2 (anterior gradient 2) and TFF1/TFF3 (trefoil factors) are associated with mucosal protection and repair, but their roles are not directly linked to a single, unified process.

3. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family and plays a role in developmental processes and cancer, but it does not appear to be functionally integrated with the majority of the other proteins listed.

4. The presence of immune-related proteins such as HLA-DOB (an MHC class II protein) and CXCL12 (a chemokine) suggests involvement in immune response, yet this does not represent a primary process for the entire group.

Several proteins in this system, such as CD44, VCAN (Versican), and CHI3L1 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1), are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. VCAN is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in tissue remodeling and is often upregulated in various cancers.

2. Proteins like EXT1 (Exostosin-1) and XYLT1 (Xylosyltransferase 1) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, respectively. These activities are crucial for the structure and function of the ECM, which is a key component of the tumor microenvironment.

3. The presence of proteins such as TNFRSF21 (Death receptor 6) and TNFSF10 (TRAIL) indicates involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways. These proteins can modulate cell death and survival, which are critical processes in cancer progression and response to therapy.

4. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family of proteins that are involved in regulating cell fate and patterning during development. In the context of cancer, WNT5A has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.

5. The system includes immune-related proteins such as IGHM, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20, and IGL, which are components of immunoglobulins. These suggest a role in immune surveillance or response within the tumor microenvironment.

6. Proteins like TGFBR2 (Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II) and S100A6 are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGFBR2 is a key mediator of TGF-beta signaling, which has complex roles in tumor progression, including tumor suppression in early stages and promotion of invasion and metastasis in later stages.

7. The presence of XIST, a long non-coding RNA involved in X chromosome inactivation, suggests a potential role in epigenetic regulation within the system, although its specific role in this context is less clear.

In summary, the proteins in this system are collectively involved in the dynamic modulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly through ECM remodeling, cell adhesion, migration, immune response, and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival. The interplay of these proteins contributes to the structural and functional complexity of the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression and metastasis."	0.85	animal organ formation	GO:0048645	0.0040361701254554	4	70	35	CHI3L1,VCAN,DDX3Y,MSRB2	tumor microenvironment modulation  and  extracellular matrix remodeling	animal organ formation	0.25299045	0.039603960396039604	0.11428571428571428	CD44 VCAN CHI3L1 EXT1 XYLT1 TNFRSF21 TNFSF10 WNT5A TGFBR2 S100A6	10.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the given name ""Tumor Microenvironment Modulation and Extracellular Matrix Remodeling"" due to their roles in ECM remodeling, cell adhesion, migration, immune response, and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival.

FASN, or fatty acid synthase, is a multi-enzyme protein that catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH. It is a key player in de novo lipogenesis and is often upregulated in various cancers, providing necessary lipids for rapid cell growth.

2. SLC27A2, also known as FATP2, is involved in the uptake and activation of long-chain fatty acids. It is implicated in fatty acid transport and metabolism, and its activity complements the de novo synthesis pathway mediated by FASN.

3. UGDH, or UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans, which are components of the extracellular matrix. It is indirectly related to lipid metabolism through its role in producing UDP-glucuronic acid, which can influence glycolipid synthesis.

4. GALNT10 is a polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that modifies proteins through O-linked glycosylation, which can affect protein stability and signaling, potentially influencing lipid metabolism and cell stress responses.

5. PTGES, prostaglandin E synthase, is involved in the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a lipid compound with various roles including inflammation and cell signaling.

6. MACF1, or microtubule-actin crosslinking factor 1, is a cytoskeletal linker protein that stabilizes microtubules and interacts with actin. It is implicated in intracellular transport and cell signaling, which can indirectly affect lipid metabolism and cellular stress responses.

7. MTA1, metastasis-associated protein 1, is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which influences chromatin structure and gene expression. It is associated with cancer progression and can modulate cellular stress responses.

8. MYB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in various biological processes, including cell cycle progression and differentiation. It can indirectly influence lipid metabolism through the regulation of genes involved in cell growth and metabolism.

9. PXDN, or peroxidasin, is an extracellular matrix protein with peroxidase activity that contributes to extracellular matrix formation and tissue remodeling, which can be associated with cellular stress responses.

10. STC2, stanniocalcin-2, is involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis and has been implicated in cellular stress responses, particularly in the context of hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

11. The remaining proteins, including IFITM1, 1060P11.3, A2M, ANXA1, BTG3, GPM6B, MSLN, PTGDS, and TUSC3, have diverse roles ranging from immune responses, cell proliferation, and apoptosis to lipid signaling and transport. Their collective functions suggest a broader involvement in cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in lipid metabolism, with several proteins directly participating in fatty acid synthesis, transport, and modification. Additionally, many of these proteins play roles in cellular stress responses, including responses to hypoxia, inflammation, and changes in the extracellular matrix. The interplay between these proteins suggests a system that integrates lipid metabolism with mechanisms to cope with cellular stress, which is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental challenges."	0.85	carboxylic acid biosynthetic process	GO:0046394	0.002612535322002	5	324	17	FASN,PTGES,SLC27A2,UGDH,A2M	lipid metabolism  and  cellular stress

Several proteins in this system are directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis. DHCR7, FDFT1, and MSMO1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. DHCR7 catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, FDFT1 is involved in the first committed step of sterol synthesis, and MSMO1 is responsible for the conversion of methylsterol intermediates to cholesterol.

2. INSIG1 and LDLR are critical in cholesterol regulation. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. LDLR is a cell-surface receptor responsible for the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is a primary mechanism for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream.

3. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fats are components of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides, and they play a role in the fluidity and function of biological membranes, which can indirectly affect cholesterol metabolism.

4. The presence of other proteins such as PXDN and CLDN10, which are involved in extracellular matrix formation and tight junctions respectively, suggests additional roles in tissue organization and integrity, which may be related to the broader context of cholesterol metabolism and its impact on cellular structures.

5. Proteins like TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2) indicate a connection to signaling pathways that can influence cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which may intersect with cholesterol metabolism in complex ways, such as in the regulation of cell growth and the synthesis of membrane components.

To summarize, the prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is centered around cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation. The system includes enzymes directly involved in the production of cholesterol, proteins that regulate its synthesis and uptake, and factors that may influence or be influenced by cholesterol metabolism in the context of cell signaling and structural integrity. The confidence score reflects that while a significant number of proteins are involved in cholesterol-related processes, there are additional proteins with functions that are not directly related to cholesterol but may be part of broader cellular contexts in which cholesterol plays a role."	0.85	cholesterol biosynthetic process	GO:0006695	0.0003506232798447	4	54	28	COL5A1,FAP,FDFT1,LDLR	cholesterol biosynthesis  and  regulation	cholesterol biosynthetic process	0.7802311	0.05128205128205128	0.14285714285714285	DHCR7 FDFT1 MSMO1 INSIG1 LDLR	5.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Regulation"" because they are directly involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol.

Signal Transduction: Proteins such as EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) and NTRK2 (Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2) are involved in cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and survival. GRB14 is an adaptor protein that interacts with insulin receptors and may modulate insulin signaling.

2. Immune Response: CCL13 and CCL18 are chemokines involved in the immune response, attracting immune cells to sites of inflammation. CD59 is a complement regulatory protein that inhibits the complement membrane attack complex.

3. Metabolism: Enzymes like CPM (Carboxypeptidase M) and CTSB (Cathepsin B) are involved in protein processing and degradation. ALDH1A2 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A2) is involved in retinoic acid biosynthesis, which is important for cellular differentiation and metabolism.

4. Extracellular Matrix and Cell Adhesion: Proteins such as LAMA4 (Laminin Subunit Alpha 4) and TGFBI (Transforming Growth Factor Beta-Induced) are implicated in cell adhesion and the composition of the extracellular matrix.

5. Transcription Factors and Development: SOX9 and SOX11 are transcription factors involved in development and cell fate determination. PLAGL1 (Pleomorphic Adenoma Gene-Like 1) is a zinc finger protein that may play a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

6. Cellular Structure: Keratins such as KRT5, KRT13, and KRT14 are structural proteins of epithelial cells. They contribute to the mechanical integrity of cells and tissues.

7. Proteolysis and Inhibition: Proteins like PLAU (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator) are involved in proteolysis, whereas SERPINB9 is a serine protease inhibitor.

Given the broad spectrum of functions and the lack of a unifying biological process, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that the proteins do not collectively represent a single, coherent biological process."	0.0	apoptotic process	GO:0006915	1.2788143424070018e-05	25	1913	76	BICC1,CRYL1,CSGALNACT1,DLK1,EFEMP1,ENC1,FGFR3,LY75,MS4A4A,PLAU,PSMD10,RPL31,TEX30,TSPAN13,ZNF185,A2M,ACKR3,BMP2,CEMIP,CITED2,FIS1,LGALS4,MUC1,RGS5,SOX11	system of unrelated proteins	apoptotic process		0.012729124236252547	0.32894736842105265											False	True

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and systemic functions, including but not limited to:

1. Enzymatic activity and metabolism (e.g., AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, ALOX5, GBE1, HMOX1, NQO1),
2. Immune response and inflammation (e.g., ADM, HLA-DQA1, S100A8, S100A9),
3. Stress response and protein folding (e.g., HSPA1A, HSPA6, HSPH1),
4. Cell signaling and growth (e.g., VEGFA, WNT5A, TGFB1),
5. Structural components and extracellular matrix organization (e.g., ACTG2, COL11A1, POSTN),
6. Transport and channel activity (e.g., AQP3, SLC39A6),
7. Transcriptional regulation and gene expression (e.g., LEF1, DDIT4, GADD45B).

Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying theme in their functions, it is not possible to assign a single biological process that is prominently performed by this system. The proteins listed participate in multiple, distinct pathways and processes that are critical to various aspects of cellular and organismal physiology.

The interactions between these proteins, if any, are likely to be context-dependent and not indicative of a cohesive biological process. Therefore, the most accurate description for this collection of proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the absence of a predominant biological process and the broad spectrum of unrelated functions they represent. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a single, prominent biological process within this system."	0.0	response to oxygen-containing compound	GO:1901700	2.0850120070337977e-08	25	1663	65	1060P11.3,ADM,AKR1C1,AKR1C2,COL11A1,CX3CR1,DOK5,GBE1,GSDMB,H2BC8,HSPA6,LEF1,MKNK1,MS4A1,NQO1,NT5E,TXNL4B,WNT5A,AQP3,GNA15,HPGD,MAP7,RRBP1,TCTA,TFPI	system of unrelated proteins	response to oxygen-containing compound		0.014679976512037582	0.38461538461538464											False	True

These proteins function in various stages of cell division, including chromosome segregation, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis.

2. Proteins such as CCND2 (cyclin D2) and CDKs (not listed but implied by the presence of cyclins) are crucial for the transition through the G1/S checkpoint in the cell cycle. CCNF (cyclin F) also plays a role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G2 phase.

3. Proteins like FDXR, GADD45A, and DDIT4 are involved in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage, which can lead to cell cycle arrest. This indicates a system that not only promotes cell division but also has checks and balances to ensure genomic integrity.

4. The presence of proteins such as FAS and DKK3, which are involved in apoptosis and cell signaling pathways, suggests a link between cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death, further emphasizing the system's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

5. Proteins like EMP1, CD44, and CDH1 are associated with cell adhesion and signaling, which can influence cell cycle progression and tissue architecture, indicating a broader role in tissue maintenance and possibly cancer biology.

6. The system also includes proteins like ASPM and AURKA, which are implicated in neurogenesis and spindle orientation, respectively, suggesting a potential role in the development and differentiation of specific cell types.

7. Several proteins, such as LGALS3BP and SERPINA1, are involved in various cellular processes, including immune response and protease inhibition, which may indirectly influence cell cycle progression through cellular signaling pathways.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into the regulation and progression of the cell cycle, with additional roles in DNA damage response, apoptosis, and cell adhesion. The interplay between these proteins ensures proper cell division, genomic integrity, and tissue homeostasis, which are critical for normal development and the prevention of diseases such as cancer."	0.92	mitotic cell cycle process	GO:1903047	2.102455054396344e-14	26	745	85	BTG2,RNF128,TRIM22,ASPM,AURKA,BUB1,CA12,CCNF,CENPA,DBF4,DLGAP5,HOXC6,JADE2,KIF14,KIF18B,KIF20A,KYNU,MKI67,NEK2,PDLIM5,PSRC1,TOP2A,TPM4,TPX2,TTK,UBE2S	cell cycle progression  and  regulation	mitotic cell cycle process	0.6500951	0.03233830845771144	0.3058823529411765	AURKA BIRC5 BUB1 CENPA CENPF DBF4 DLGAP5 GTSE1 KIF14 KIF18B KIF20A KIF23 KIF2C MKI67 NEK2 PLK1 SPAG5 TTK UBE2C UBE2S CCND2 CCNF	22.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes mentioned in the text are directly involved in the regulation and progression of the cell cycle, including key processes such as chromosome segregation, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis.

LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the uptake of cholesterol from the bloodstream, providing feedback regulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis.

3. FASN (fatty acid synthase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of fatty acids, a process closely related to the production of cholesterol, as both pathways share precursors and regulatory mechanisms.

4. Several other proteins in the system, such as DDX17 (DEAD-box helicase 17) and KDELR3 (KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 3), may not be directly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis but can influence the process indirectly through their roles in RNA processing and protein trafficking, respectively.

5. The presence of NOTCH2 (Notch homolog 2) suggests a link to cellular differentiation and proliferation, which could be related to the demand for cholesterol in membrane synthesis during cell growth.

6. The system also includes proteins with more diverse functions that do not directly relate to cholesterol metabolism, such as AGTR1 (angiotensin II receptor type 1) involved in blood pressure regulation, and BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like) which is implicated in apoptosis and autophagy.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, indicating a strong emphasis on cholesterol homeostasis. The interplay between enzymes of the biosynthesis pathway, regulatory proteins, and receptors ensures tight control of cholesterol levels within cells and throughout the body. However, the presence of proteins with unrelated functions suggests that not all components of the system are dedicated to this process, which is reflected in the confidence score."	0.85	cholesterol biosynthetic process	GO:0006695	0.0028222600379124	4	54	43	DDX17,FASN,FDFT1,IGF2BP3	cholesterol biosynthesis  and  regulation	cholesterol biosynthetic process	0.7802311	0.043010752688172046	0.09302325581395349	HMGCS1 DHCR24 FDFT1 INSIG1 LDLR	5.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Regulation"" because they are directly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol.

Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1), FDFT1 (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1), FDPS (farnesyl diphosphate synthase), SQLE (squalene epoxidase), DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase), MSMO1 (methylsterol monooxygenase 1), SC5D (sterol-C5-desaturase), and CYP51A1 (cytochrome P450, family 51), are directly involved in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids.

2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. INSIG1 is an ER membrane protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that regulate the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. LDLR is responsible for the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, thus reducing plasma cholesterol levels.

3. IDI1 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1) is involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is a precursor to cholesterol synthesis.

4. CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) and DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4) may indirectly influence cholesterol biosynthesis through their roles in gene expression and stress response, respectively.

5. Other proteins such as GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase pi 1), SERPINE2 (serpin family E member 2), and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) are involved in various cellular processes including detoxification, blood coagulation, and cell-matrix interactions, which may not directly relate to cholesterol biosynthesis but could influence the overall cellular environment in which cholesterol metabolism occurs.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as metabolism, transport, stress response, signal transduction, and gene regulation. Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying process, the proteins in this system cannot be categorized under a specific biological process with high confidence. Here is a brief overview of the diversity present:

1. Metabolic enzymes like AKR1B10, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, ALDH3A1, ALDH3A2, G6PD, and ME1 are involved in various metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, detoxification, and redox homeostasis.

2. Transport proteins such as ABCB6, AQP9, SLC48A1, SLC7A11, and SLC7A7 are implicated in the movement of molecules across cellular membranes, including ions, water, and small solutes.

3. Stress response proteins like HMOX1, HSPA1A, and HSPA6 are part of the cellular response to various stress conditions, including oxidative stress and heat shock.

4. Transcription factors and gene regulators such as BCL6, FOSL1, HES1, and SOX4 play roles in the control of gene expression and are involved in diverse processes like development, differentiation, and immune response.

5. Signaling molecules like IRS2, KCNJ2, and TRIB3 are involved in signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular responses to external stimuli.

Given the broad range of unrelated functions, it is not possible to assign a single, coherent biological process to this system of proteins. Therefore, the most appropriate designation for this system is “System of unrelated proteins,” reflecting the lack of a predominant biological process and the diverse nature of the protein functions involved. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a unifying process for this group of proteins."	0.0	cellular ketone metabolic process	GO:0042180	2.1133851769749806e-06	10	223	65	ABHD4,AKR1B10,AKR1C1,AKR1C2,IL1R2,ME1,NQO1,SLC48A1,SLC7A11,TMEM158	system of unrelated proteins	cellular ketone metabolic process		0.03597122302158273	0.15384615384615385											False	True

The proteins 1060P11.3, DNAJB1, and SQSTM1 are associated with cellular stress responses. DNAJB1 is a co-chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins and the stabilization of unfolded proteins, which is crucial during cellular stress. SQSTM1, also known as p62, is involved in autophagy and is a key adaptor in selective autophagy, which is a process that degrades damaged or unnecessary cellular components.

2. FOSL1 is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, which is involved in various cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is often activated in response to stress signals and contributes to the regulation of genes involved in the immune response.

3. GCLM is a subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione, an important antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress.

4. HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 are MHC class II molecules that play a critical role in the immune system by presenting peptide antigens to T cells, which is essential for the adaptive immune response.

HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. It is subject to complex regulation by various mechanisms, including feedback inhibition by cholesterol derivatives.

2. HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1) is another key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, catalyzing the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is then reduced by HMGCR.

3. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) is a regulatory protein that binds to HMGCR and facilitates its degradation, thus playing a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis. It acts as a mediator of sterol-regulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HMGCR.

4. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) is involved in the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, which is a primary mechanism for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream and regulating intracellular cholesterol levels.

5. PCSK1 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1) is an enzyme that processes precursor proteins into their active forms. It is involved in the maturation of proteins that participate in cholesterol metabolism, such as proproteins that become receptors or enzymes in lipid metabolic pathways.

The proteins listed above are directly involved in the synthesis, regulation, and uptake of cholesterol, indicating a system primarily engaged in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation. The interplay between these proteins ensures that cholesterol levels within cells and in the bloodstream are tightly controlled, which is critical for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and producing steroid hormones and bile acids.

Several proteins in this system, such as FADS1, FASN, HMGCS1, INSIG1, LDLR, LSS, MSMO1, SCD, and SQLE, are directly involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis. FADS1 is involved in the desaturation of fatty acids, a critical step in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. FASN is a key enzyme in de novo lipogenesis, catalyzing the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. HMGCS1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis.

2. INSIG1 is a regulatory protein that mediates feedback control of cholesterol synthesis by binding to sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). LDLR is a receptor that mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. LSS, MSMO1, and SQLE are all enzymes involved in the multi-step process of cholesterol synthesis, with SQLE being a rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway.

3. SCD is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are important components of membrane phospholipids and also serve as lipid signaling molecules.

4. Other proteins in the system, such as CYP1B1 and SERPING1, have roles that are tangentially related to lipid metabolism. CYP1B1 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of various lipophilic compounds, and SERPING1 is a serine protease inhibitor that can influence inflammation and vascular function, processes that are affected by lipid metabolism.

5. The remaining proteins, including 1060P11.3, HSPA6, PEG3, PTBP3, RHOB, RPL37A, RPL38, ACTG2, BCHE, CASP1, CD40, CDKN2A, MAGEA3, RGS1, RGS2, SORL1, WLS, and NPY1R, are involved in a diverse array of biological processes. These range from protein synthesis (RPL37A, RPL38), stress response (HSPA6), apoptosis (CASP1), cell cycle regulation (CDKN2A), to signal transduction (RGS1, RGS2) and neurotransmission (NPY1R). While these proteins have important roles in cellular function, they do not directly contribute to the central process of lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis, with a significant number of proteins directly participating in these pathways. However, the presence of proteins with diverse and unrelated functions suggests that this system also engages in other cellular processes, which is reflected in the confidence score."	0.85	sterol metabolic process	GO:0016125	1.5000683585228085e-06	7	152	28	1060P11.3,FASN,HSPA6,INSIG1,LDLR,LSS,SERPING1	lipid metabolism  and  cholesterol biosynthesis	sterol metabolic process	0.78553617	0.04046242774566474	0.25	FADS1 FASN HMGCS1 INSIG1 LDLR LSS MSMO1 SCD SQLE	9.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Lipid Metabolism and Cholesterol Biosynthesis"" as several genes are directly involved in these processes.

The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a cellular defense mechanism activated by various stress conditions, including amino acid deprivation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Proteins such as ATF3, ATF4, DDIT3 (also known as CHOP), and GADD45A are key transcription factors and downstream effectors in the ISR. They regulate gene expression to restore cellular homeostasis or induce apoptosis if the stress is too severe.

2. ER-associated proteins like DNAJC10 (ERdj5), DNAJC3 (P58IPK), EDEM1, HERPUD1, HSPA5 (BiP/GRP78), and SERP1 are involved in protein folding and the unfolded protein response (UPR), a subset of the ISR. These proteins help to alleviate ER stress by enhancing the degradation of misfolded proteins and improving the protein folding capacity of the ER.

3. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as CARS, GARS, IARS, and WARS are essential for protein synthesis, linking amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs. Under stress conditions, they can have non-canonical functions, including signaling roles in the ISR.

4. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of proteins that provides structural support to cells and tissues. COL1A1 and COL4A5 are collagen proteins that contribute to the ECM's integrity. LAMB1 is a laminin, crucial for basement membrane assembly. THBS2 and CHI3L1 are involved in ECM remodeling and cell-matrix interactions.

5. Proteins like HMGCR and HMGCS1 are key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis, which is tightly regulated by cellular stress and energy status. LDLR is involved in cholesterol uptake, and SCD is a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis, indicating a link between stress response and lipid metabolism.

6. Several proteins in the system, such as ASS1, ASNS, PSAT1, and GFPT1, are involved in amino acid metabolism and the cellular response to amino acid availability, which is closely related to the ISR.

7. MYC is a well-known oncogene and transcription factor that regulates various cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. Its activity can be influenced by stress responses and nutrient availability.

8. The presence of proteins like CD163, CFH, and VSIG4, which are involved in immune responses and inflammation, suggests a connection between stress responses and immune modulation.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the cellular response to various stress conditions, particularly the ISR and UPR, which aim to restore homeostasis through transcriptional regulation, protein folding, and degradation.

Several proteins in this system, including DNAJB9, DNAJC10, DNAJC3, EDEM1, EIF2AK3, HSP90B1, and PDIA4, are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and protein folding. These proteins function as chaperones, foldases, and components of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER.

2. The UPR is a cellular stress response related to the ER and is involved in the quality control of protein folding. Key elements of this response include the upregulation of molecular chaperones (HSP90B1, DNAJB9) and enzymes that facilitate protein folding (PDIA4), as well as signaling pathways that lead to the reduction of protein synthesis and enhancement of degradation pathways to restore ER homeostasis.

2. Proteins like COL11A1 and COL2A1 are major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and are involved in its formation and maintenance. MMP13 is a matrix metalloproteinase that degrades components of the ECM, playing a role in tissue remodeling and repair.

3. The presence of antioxidant enzymes such as AKR1C1, AKR1C2, GCLM, HMOX1, and TXNRD1 indicates a system involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protection against oxidative stress. These enzymes work synergistically to maintain cellular redox homeostasis.

4. MYC is a well-known transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cell proliferation, growth, and metabolism. It can interact with other proteins in the system to modulate various cellular processes.

5. Proteins like ABCB6, FOLR1, and SLC7A11 are involved in transport functions across the cell membrane, including the transport of folate (FOLR1) and cystine (SLC7A11), which are important for cell survival and function.

6. The presence of immune-related proteins such as SERPINA3 and components of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IGHM) suggests a role in immune response modulation.

7. Proteins involved in signal transduction and cellular communication, such as RGS5 and BLNK, indicate a system that can respond to extracellular signals and mediate intracellular signaling pathways.

8. The system also includes proteins like LOX, which is involved in the cross-linking of collagen and elastin in the ECM, and FOSL1, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex that regulates gene expression in response to various stimuli.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in managing cellular stress and maintaining redox balance, as well as remodeling the extracellular matrix. These processes are crucial for cell survival, adaptation to environmental changes, and tissue repair. The system reflects a coordinated response to stress and damage, with implications for cell growth, differentiation, and immune interactions."	0.85	regulation of response to stimulus	GO:0048583	4.159488859180463e-05	22	3939	36	AKR1C1,COL11A1,COL2A1,DDIT4,DNAJB1,FABP7,FOLR1,FOSL1,GCLM,HSPA6,STK26,SERPINA3,SLC7A11,TXNRD1,BLNK,C7,CD9,GEM,GPD1L,MYH10,PPP3CA,RCBTB2	cellular stress response  and  extracellular matrix remodeling	response to stimulus	0.5211628	0.005565393372122439	0.6111111111111112	DNAJB1 HSPA6 DDIT4 COL11A1 COL2A1 MMP13 AKR1C1 AKR1C2 GCLM HMOX1 TXNRD1 LOX FOSL1	13.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Extracellular Matrix Remodeling"" by participating in cellular stress responses, redox balance, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular pathways, including but not limited to signal transduction, metabolism, cell structure and motility, gene regulation, and immune responses. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Several proteins such as ACBD3, DDX3Y, EIF1AY, and RPS4Y1 are involved in fundamental cellular processes like protein synthesis and RNA processing, which are ubiquitous across cell types.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), EPAS1 (Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1), and TSC22D3 (TSC22 domain family protein 3), are known to be involved in cellular stress responses. DDIT4 is a modulator of the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. EPAS1, also known as HIF-2α, is a transcription factor that responds to hypoxia and regulates genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. TSC22D3 is a glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein that can regulate inflammatory responses and cellular growth.

2. The presence of metabolic enzymes such as ASNS (asparagine synthetase), GLS (glutaminase), PCK2 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2), and PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) indicates a role in metabolic regulation. ASNS is involved in the biosynthesis of asparagine and adaptation to cellular stress, while GLS catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, a key step in energy and nitrogen metabolism. PCK2 is an enzyme in gluconeogenesis, converting oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and PGK1 is a glycolytic enzyme, highlighting the system's involvement in balancing energy production and consumption.

3. Chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL11, along with their regulatory proteins, suggest a role in immune response and inflammation. These chemokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, which is critical during stress and injury.

4. Proteins like CAV1 (caveolin 1) and ENPP2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2) are involved in signal transduction and lipid metabolism, respectively. CAV1 is a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes, influencing various signaling pathways, while ENPP2 is involved in the generation of lysophosphatidic acid, a lipid signaling molecule.

5. Growth factors and their regulators, such as AREG (amphiregulin), EREG (epiregulin), BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4), and FAM129A (family with sequence similarity 129 member A), are indicative of roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development.

6. The presence of XIST (X inactive specific transcript) suggests a connection to epigenetic regulation, as XIST is involved in X-chromosome inactivation, a process of dosage compensation in females.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, immune response, signal transduction, and growth factor activity. The system appears to be geared towards maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes, with a significant number of proteins contributing to these processes.

ATAD5 is a protein that plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair. It is involved in the regulation of the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) trimer, which is essential for DNA polymerase function during DNA replication. ATAD5 is known to facilitate the unloading of PCNA from DNA after replication and repair processes, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability.

2. FANCI is a key component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, a DNA repair mechanism that is particularly important for the repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). FANCI forms a complex with FANCD2, which is monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage. This modification is crucial for the activation of the FA pathway and coordination of ICL repair with the replication machinery.

3. PHLPP1 (PH domain and Leucine rich repeat Protein Phosphatase 1) is a phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth, survival, and metabolism. While PHLPP1 is not directly involved in DNA repair, its role in cell signaling can influence cellular responses to DNA damage and stress, potentially impacting the efficiency of DNA repair processes.

4. RAD51AP1 (RAD51 Associated Protein 1) is directly involved in the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, a high-fidelity DNA repair process. RAD51AP1 interacts with RAD51, a recombinase that facilitates the search for homology and strand pairing during HR. RAD51AP1 enhances the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51, promoting efficient repair of double-strand breaks.

5. USP1 (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 1) and its cofactor WDR48 (WD Repeat Domain 48) are involved in the deubiquitination of FANCD2 and PCNA. USP1-WDR48 complex regulates the FA pathway by reversing the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, which is necessary for the completion of ICL repair. Additionally, USP1 deubiquitinates PCNA, modulating the balance between DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways.

6. USP12 is another deubiquitinating enzyme that can potentially regulate protein stability and function through the removal of ubiquitin modifications. While its specific role in DNA repair is less characterized, it may contribute to the regulation of protein turnover and function in the DNA damage response.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity through various DNA repair mechanisms. They interact in pathways that respond to DNA damage, such as the Fanconi anemia pathway and homologous recombination, and regulate the activity of key proteins through post-translational modifications. The system ensures the proper coordination of DNA repair with the replication machinery and cell cycle progression, which is essential for preventing genomic instability and maintaining cellular homeostasis."	0.92	positive regulation of DNA recombination	GO:0045911	0.0002520020094945	3	70	7	ATAD5,RAD51AP1,WDR48	dna damage response  and  repair	dna recombination	0.62802637	0.04054054054054054	0.42857142857142855	ATAD5 FANCI RAD51AP1 USP1 WDR48	5.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are directly involved in DNA damage response and repair mechanisms.

AK2 (Adenylate Kinase 2) is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space where it catalyzes the conversion of AMP and ATP into two molecules of ADP, an important reaction in cellular energy homeostasis. It plays a role in maintaining the adenine nucleotide pool within the mitochondria, which is critical for ATP synthesis and energy transfer throughout the cell.

2. CDH1 (E-Cadherin) is a transmembrane protein that mediates calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion and is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the epithelium. It is involved in mechanisms that regulate cell polarity, tissue architecture, and suppression of cancer progression.

3. HADHA and HADHB are subunits of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), an enzyme complex anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane that catalyzes three steps in the beta-oxidation spiral of long-chain fatty acids. This process is essential for the conversion of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle for energy production.

4. MT-ATP8 and MT-ND4L are components of the mitochondrial DNA-encoded ATP synthase and NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), respectively. These proteins are integral to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which generates the majority of cellular ATP through the electron transport chain.

EGFR, or Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by binding of its specific ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). Upon activation, EGFR undergoes a transition from an inactive monomeric form to an active homodimer. This dimerization leads to autophosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the C-terminal domain of EGFR, which initiates a variety of downstream signaling pathways. These pathways include the MAPK, Akt, and JNK pathways, which are involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.

2. NR3C1, also known as the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), is a steroid hormone receptor that regulates gene expression in response to glucocorticoids. Upon ligand binding, NR3C1 translocates to the nucleus where it can act as a transcription factor, influencing the expression of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. It plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammatory responses, metabolism, and stress responses.

3. PRDX1, PRDX2, and PRDX5 are members of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes, which reduce peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, to water and alcohol, respectively. These enzymes play a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by regulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). They also participate in redox signaling by modulating the activity of various transcription factors and signaling molecules.

4. TXN, or Thioredoxin, is a small redox protein that acts as an antioxidant by facilitating the reduction of other proteins by cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange. Thioredoxin is part of the thioredoxin system, which includes thioredoxin reductase and NADPH, and plays a role in redox homeostasis. It is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis.

The proteins in this system are functionally integrated to manage cellular responses to oxidative stress and to regulate signal transduction pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and survival. EGFR and NR3C1 are key players in signal transduction, while PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX5, and TXN are central to maintaining redox balance within the cell. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to cellular stress, where signal transduction is modulated by the oxidative state of the cell, which is in turn regulated by the peroxiredoxins and thioredoxin. This system reflects a complex network where redox regulation is intimately linked with signaling pathways that are critical for cellular adaptation to stress and maintenance of homeostasis."	0.92	hydrogen peroxide metabolic process	GO:0042743	5.270133330141658e-10	5	55	6	EGFR,PRDX1,PRDX2,PRDX5,TXN	redox regulation  and  signal transduction in cellular stress response	hydrogen peroxide metabolic process	0.47743523	0.08928571428571429	0.8333333333333334	EGFR NR3C1 PRDX1 PRDX2 PRDX5 TXN	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Redox regulation and signal transduction in cellular stress response"" as it includes genes involved in both redox balance and signal transduction pathways.

ACTL6A, CHD3, and ING4 are components of chromatin remodeling complexes that alter the structure of chromatin to regulate access to DNA. ACTL6A is part of the SWI/SNF complex, which is involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes. CHD3 is a member of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex, which has roles in chromatin compaction and gene silencing. ING4 associates with histone acetyltransferase complexes and can modulate chromatin structure and transcription.

2. BCL6, CREBBP, EP300, NR3C1, RELA, RUNX1, TP53, and YY1 are transcription factors or co-regulators that directly influence gene expression. BCL6 is a sequence-specific repressor of transcription, while CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that activate transcription by remodeling chromatin. NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response. RELA is a subunit of NF-kB, a transcription factor involved in inflammatory and immune responses. RUNX1 is critical for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. TP53 (p53) is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in apoptosis, growth arrest, and DNA repair. YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor that can act as an activator, repressor, or initiator-binding protein.

3. H2AFZ and HIST1H4A are histone variants; H2AFZ is a replacement for the canonical histone H2A and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. HIST1H4A is a core component of the nucleosome, and its post-translational modifications are critical for transcriptional regulation.

4. HNRNPD (also known as AUF1) is an RNA-binding protein that influences mRNA stability and turnover, thereby indirectly affecting gene expression.

5. KAT6A and TERT are involved in modifying chromatin structure and telomere maintenance, respectively. KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase that can regulate transcription through chromatin remodeling. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, can also regulate gene expression independently of its role in telomere elongation.

6. MTA3, PML, TBL1XR1, and TNF are involved in various aspects of chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation. MTA3 is a component of the NuRD complex, like CHD3, and is involved in gene silencing. PML is involved in the formation of nuclear bodies and can regulate transcription. TBL1XR1 is part of the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex, which mediates transcriptional repression. TNF is primarily known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine but can also influence gene expression through activation of NF-kB.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure and transcription. They work in concert to modulate gene expression patterns necessary for various cellular processes, including development, metabolism, immune response, and maintenance of genomic integrity.

The KLHL (Kelch-like) family members, including KLHL2, KLHL3, KLHL12, KLHL22, and KLHL25, typically contain BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac) domains that facilitate the formation of CRL complexes by interacting with Cullin proteins and RING-box proteins. They are implicated in various cellular processes through the targeted degradation of proteins.

3. The KCTD (Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain containing) proteins, such as KCTD9 and KCTD11, also contain BTB domains and are involved in the assembly and regulation of CRL complexes. They contribute to the specificity of the ubiquitination process by recognizing and binding to specific substrates.

4. RHOBTB2 and RHOBTB3 are atypical members of the Rho family and have been implicated in the regulation of CRL3 complexes. They may act as adaptors or regulators within these complexes, influencing the ubiquitination of various proteins.

5. WNK (With No lysine (K)) kinases, including WNK1, WNK2, WNK3, and WNK4, are a family of serine/threonine-protein kinases that do not directly interact with CRL complexes but are known to be involved in the regulation of ion transport and signaling pathways. Their activity can be modulated by ubiquitination, suggesting a potential indirect link with the CRL system through regulation of kinase activity or stability.

6. SHKBP1 acts as an adaptor that links WNK kinases to the CRL3 complex, suggesting a coordinated regulation of WNK kinase activity and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes, which play a critical role in protein turnover and cellular homeostasis. The WNK kinases, while not directly part of the CRL complexes, are subject to regulation by ubiquitination, which may be facilitated by the action of the other proteins in this system. The interplay between these proteins ensures precise control of protein degradation, affecting various cellular processes."	0.85	negative regulation of pancreatic juice secretion	GO:0090188	3.0534371983194537e-06	3	5	16	WNK1,WNK3,WNK4	cullin-ring ubiquitin ligase (crl) complexes	pancreatic juice secretion	0.18908814	0.16666666666666666	0.1875	ANKRD39 BTBD9 KCTD9 KCTD11 KLHL2 KLHL3 KLHL12 KLHL22 KLHL25 RHOBTB2 RHOBTB3 SHKBP1	12.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the regulation of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, either as substrate adaptors, regulators, or through indirect modulation.

The diversity of the protein functions ranges from developmental roles to various signaling pathways and structural components. Here is a brief analysis of the functional categories represented:

1. Developmental Proteins: Proteins like BMP10, DAND5, and PCDH19 are involved in developmental processes. BMP10 is a member of the bone morphogenetic protein family which is involved in cardiac development. DAND5 is a known antagonist of certain TGF-beta signaling pathways, influencing embryonic development. PCDH19 is implicated in the development of the nervous system.

2. Signaling Molecules: Several proteins such as GNRH2, PTCHD1, and PTP4A3 are involved in signaling pathways. GNRH2 is a neuropeptide that plays a role in the regulation of reproductive hormones. PTCHD1 is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development. PTP4A3 is a phosphatase involved in various signaling pathways, including those related to cancer progression.

3. Structural and Transport Proteins: Proteins like MYO15B and SLC14A2 are associated with structural functions or transport. MYO15B is a myosin protein implicated in hair cell development and function in the inner ear. SLC14A2 is a urea transporter, playing a role in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine.

4. Synaptic and Neuronal Proteins: NRXN3 and IGSF9B are involved in neuronal function. NRXN3 is a neuronal cell adhesion molecule implicated in synapse function. IGSF9B is involved in the development of the nervous system and synaptic organization.

5. Miscellaneous Functions: The remaining proteins have diverse roles, such as AGBL4 which is a cytosolic carboxypeptidase, and CDKL4 which is a cyclin-dependent kinase-like protein, potentially involved in cell cycle regulation.

Given the broad spectrum of unrelated functions, it is not possible to assign a single biological process to this system of interacting proteins. The proteins do not collectively represent a coherent pathway or process that can be succinctly named. Therefore, the most appropriate designation for this group is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the lack of a unifying biological process among the proteins listed. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a prominent biological process within this system."	0.0	inhibitory chemical synaptic transmission	GO:0098977	0.1589395704551415	1	3	29	PSORS1C1	system of unrelated proteins	inhibitory chemical synaptic transmission		0.03225806451612903	0.034482758620689655											False	False

The HOX family of proteins, including HOXA1 through HOXA6, HOXA11, HOXB2 through HOXB9, and HOXD3 through HOXD11, are transcription factors that play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. They are known for their involvement in patterning the anterior-posterior axis and specifying regional identity in the developing embryo.

2. The HOXA cluster proteins, such as HOXA1 and HOXA2, are essential for the proper development of the hindbrain and branchial arches. They are also implicated in the differentiation of various cell types and organs, including the limbs, gut, and reproductive system.

3. Similarly, the HOXB cluster proteins, including HOXB2 through HOXB9, are involved in the development of the axial skeleton, limbs, and genitourinary system. They contribute to the segmental organization of the embryo and are crucial for the formation of the vertebral column and thoracic cage.

4. The HOXD cluster proteins, such as HOXD3 through HOXD11, are particularly important for limb development, including the patterning of digits and the establishment of limb identity. They also play roles in the development of the urogenital system and the gastrointestinal tract.

5. The coordinated expression of HOX proteins is tightly regulated and involves complex interactions with other transcription factors, cofactors, and epigenetic modifiers. These interactions ensure the precise spatial and temporal expression patterns required for normal development.

6. The HOX proteins often function in a combinatorial manner, with multiple HOX proteins binding to DNA regulatory elements to control the expression of target genes. This combinatorial code contributes to the diversity of developmental outcomes and the specificity of tissue patterning.

To summarize, the HOX proteins in this system are central to the regulation of developmental gene expression. They are involved in the specification of body plan and the differentiation of structures along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. The system of interacting proteins functions in a highly coordinated and integrated manner to control the expression of genes critical for proper embryonic development."	0.98	embryonic skeletal system development	GO:0048706	2.3446415282655603e-35	18	128	21	HOXA2,HOXA3,HOXA4,HOXA5,HOXA6,HOXA11,HOXB2,HOXB3,HOXB4,HOXB5,HOXB6,HOXB7,HOXB8,HOXB9,HOXD3,HOXD4,HOXD9,HOXD10	developmental gene expression	embryonic skeletal system development	0.5782368	0.13740458015267176	0.8571428571428571	HOXA1 HOXA2 HOXA3 HOXA4 HOXA5 HOXA6 HOXA11 HOXB2 HOXB3 HOXB4 HOXB5 HOXB6 HOXB7 HOXB8 HOXB9 HOXD3 HOXD4 HOXD8 HOXD9 HOXD10 HOXD11	21.0	"-- Summary --||The provided text describes the HOX family of proteins, including specific HOXA, HOXB, and HOXD cluster genes, as transcription factors crucial for regulating gene expression during embryonic development.

However, zinc finger proteins are a large family with diverse functions and target genes, making it difficult to assign a single biological process to this group without additional context.

Other proteins in the list, such as SLC39A6 and SLC39A10, are members of the solute carrier family and are involved in metal ion transport. Their functions are critical for cellular metal homeostasis but are not directly related to the functions of zinc finger proteins.

Proteins like EPM2AIP1, TBC1D19, and TPGS1 have roles in various cellular processes including mRNA processing, intracellular trafficking, and protein transport, respectively. These functions, while essential to cellular operation, do not suggest a common biological process shared with the other proteins in the list.

TTC23, TTLL1, and MYSM1 are involved in processes such as tubulin modification, histone demethylation, and gene expression regulation. Again, these are important cellular functions but do not align under a single biological process with the other proteins mentioned.

NICN1, PGBD1, and LRRC49, along with the zinc finger proteins ZKSCAN1, ZKSCAN8, ZSCAN1, and ZSCAN21, are involved in various aspects of nucleic acid binding and regulation, but they do not appear to converge on a specific, shared biological pathway based on the information provided.

C11orf49 is an uncharacterized protein and without further information, it is not possible to determine its role in relation to the other proteins.

Given the diversity of functions and lack of a clear, unifying biological process among these proteins, the most appropriate name for the process performed by this system is ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that these proteins do not collectively represent a single, coherent biological process based on the information available."	0.0	regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II	GO:0006357	5.826374953737252e-06	13	2567	19	LRRC49,NICN1,TTLL1,ZKSCAN1,ZKSCAN8,ZNF24,ZNF135,ZNF174,ZNF197,ZNF232,ZNF449,ZNF500,ZSCAN1	system of unrelated proteins	transcription by rna polymerase ii		0.005052467936261173	0.6842105263157895											False	True

ARSA (arylsulfatase A) is involved in the degradation of sulfatides in lysosomes. Deficiency in ARSA activity leads to a lysosomal storage disorder known as metachromatic leukodystrophy, which affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system.

2. CNP (2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase) is an enzyme highly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the production of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides. It plays a role in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath.

3. GALNS (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase) is another lysosomal enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans, specifically keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Deficiencies in GALNS activity result in Morquio A syndrome, a type of mucopolysaccharidosis.

4. MYL7 (myosin light chain 7) is a cardiac-specific myosin light chain that is part of the contractile apparatus of cardiac muscle cells. It plays a role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction.

5. SMARCB1 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1) is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. It is involved in transcriptional regulation and is implicated in tumor suppression.

6. UACA (uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats) is a protein with less well-characterized functions, but it is thought to be involved in apoptosis and may play a role in autoimmune uveitis.

The proteins listed are involved in a variety of biological processes, including lysosomal degradation, myelin sheath maintenance, cardiac muscle contraction, chromatin remodeling, and potentially apoptosis and immune response. There is no single, prominent biological process that encompasses the functions of all these proteins. Instead, they participate in distinct and separate pathways within the cell. The interactions between these proteins, if any, do not suggest a unified biological process.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, overarching biological process, the proteins in this system appear to be involved in unrelated pathways. Therefore, the most appropriate name for the biological process performed by this system is:

The proteins TUBA3C, TUBA3D, TUBA3E, TUBA8, TUBB1, TUBB3, and TUBB8 are all tubulin subunits, which are the building blocks of microtubules. Microtubules are critical for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and are essential components of the mitotic spindle during cell division. These proteins are involved in the polymerization and stabilization of microtubules, affecting cellular dynamics and architecture.

2. MAPRE2 and MAPRE3, also known as EB2 and EB3, are microtubule-associated proteins that bind to the plus-end of microtubules, regulating their dynamics and interactions with other cellular components. They are involved in microtubule-based processes such as mitosis and cell migration.

3. Proteins such as STOM (stomatin) are involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and associated with membrane integrity and ion channel regulation. SCNN1G is a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel and is involved in the regulation of sodium balance and blood pressure.

4. TXNDC9, UCHL1, and ATG4B are involved in protein folding and degradation pathways. TXNDC9 is a thioredoxin domain-containing protein that may be involved in the oxidative stress response. UCHL1 is a ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1, playing a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for protein degradation. ATG4B is a cysteine protease required for autophagy, which is the process of degrading and recycling cellular components.

5. TBCA, TBCE, and TCP1 are chaperonins involved in tubulin folding and the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. These proteins assist in the correct folding of newly synthesized proteins or the refolding of misfolded proteins.

6. TNPO1, TNPO2, and TNPO3 are transportin proteins that mediate the nuclear import of specific proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. They are part of the karyopherin family and are involved in the nuclear transport cycle.

7. XPO1 (also known as CRM1) and XPO6 are involved in nuclear export. XPO1 mediates the nuclear export of a wide variety of proteins and RNAs, while XPO6 is involved in the export of specific proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

8. PFKL and PFKP are isoforms of the enzyme phosphofructokinase, which is a key regulatory enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. They are involved in the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a rate-limiting step in glycolysis.

9. SYT9 is a member of the synaptotagmin family, which are membrane-trafficking proteins that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. NECAB2 is a neuronal calcium-binding protein, which may be involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and neurodevelopment.

10. CA9 (carbonic anhydrase IX) is involved in pH regulation and is associated with the cellular response to hypoxia.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the organization, dynamics, and function of the cytoskeleton, particularly microtubules, and in the intracellular transport of proteins and other molecules. The system also includes proteins that participate in metabolic processes, ion transport, and the cellular stress response. The interplay between these proteins supports the structural integrity of cells, the transport of cellular components, and the regulation of cellular metabolism and signaling."	0.88	microtubule cytoskeleton organization	GO:0000226	1.826082727726436e-07	11	659	27	MAPRE2,MAPRE3,TNPO3,TUBA3C,TUBA3D,TUBA3E,TUBA8,TUBB1,TUBB3,TUBB8,UCHL1	cytoskeletal organization  and  intracellular transport	microtubule cytoskeleton organization	0.7675103	0.016296296296296295	0.4074074074074074	TUBA3C TUBA3D TUBA3E TUBA8 TUBB1 TUBB3 TUBB8 MAPRE2 MAPRE3 TBCA TBCE TCP1 TNPO1 TNPO2 TNPO3 XPO1 XPO6	17.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the organization, dynamics, and function of the cytoskeleton, particularly microtubules, and in the intracellular transport of proteins and other molecules.

ABCF2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family F member 2) is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, which is involved in the transport of various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABCF2, in particular, has been implicated in the regulation of the ribosome function and response to cellular stress, potentially by modulating the translation process.

2. ARMC6 (Armadillo repeat containing 6) is a protein that may be involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cilia function and cell cycle progression. Its interaction with other proteins suggests a role in the assembly or function of some protein complexes.

3. BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A interacting protein) plays a role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. It is known to interact with BRCA2 in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle checkpoint.

4. CBX3 (Chromobox 3) is a component of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family involved in the formation of heterochromatin, gene silencing, and the regulation of transcription. It plays a role in maintaining chromatin structure and may influence protein synthesis by modulating the transcription of genes.

5. CHURC1 (Churchill domain containing 1) is less characterized but may be involved in nucleolar processes related to ribosome biogenesis or stress response pathways.

6. CWC27 (CWC27 spliceosome-associated protein homolog) is a component of the spliceosome complex that is essential for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, indicating a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

7. ELAC2 (ElaC ribonuclease Z 2) is involved in the processing of tRNA precursors, an essential step in the maturation of tRNAs and subsequent protein synthesis.

8. FAM98A (Family with sequence similarity 98 member A) and FAM161A (Family with sequence similarity 161 member A) are proteins with less well-defined functions but may be involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell division.

9. GLRX2 (Glutaredoxin 2) and GLRX3 (Glutaredoxin 3) are involved in redox reactions and the regulation of cellular oxidative stress, which can affect protein folding and function.

10. METAP2 (Methionyl aminopeptidase 2) is involved in the removal of the initiator methionine from nascent proteins, a crucial step in protein synthesis and maturation.

11. MLST8 (MTOR associated protein, LST8 homolog) is a component of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, which are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and cell growth in response to nutrients and other growth signals.

12. NSMAF (Neutral sphingomyelinase activation associated factor) is implicated in signal transduction pathways and may be involved in the response to cellular stress.

13. PCMT1 (Protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase) is involved in the repair of damaged proteins by catalyzing the methylation of abnormal L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl residues.

14. PCYT1B (Phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1, choline, beta) is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, a major component of cell membranes, which is essential for proper membrane function and signaling.

15. POC1B (POC1 centriolar protein B) is involved in centriole assembly and function, which is critical for cell division and the maintenance of cell cycle progression.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in a variety of cellular processes, with a notable emphasis on protein synthesis, including ribosome function, tRNA processing, and post-translational modifications. Additionally, several proteins are implicated in the cellular response to stress, which can influence protein folding and stability. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated system that integrates protein synthesis with cellular stress responses, ensuring proper cellular function and adaptation to changing conditions."	0.85	protein alkylation	GO:0008213	0.114161959657525	2	49	16	ELAC2,NSMAF	protein synthesis  and  cellular stress response	protein alkylation	0.50917375	0.031746031746031744	0.125	ABCF2 BCCIP CBX3 CWC27 ELAC2 GLRX2 GLRX3 METAP2 MLST8 PCMT1	10.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Protein Synthesis and Cellular Stress Response"" as many genes are directly involved in protein synthesis processes such as ribosome function, tRNA processing, and post-translational modifications.

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:

1. The proteins mentioned are involved in diverse cellular functions such as transcription regulation (AHRR, HLX, ZNF285, ZNF330, ZNF713), signal transduction (NFKBID, PLCXD1, RALGPS2, WNT10A), and cellular metabolism (PAOX, PORCN, SAT1).

2. Some proteins are implicated in developmental processes (BTN1A1, CRB2, HLX, WNT10A, TENM2, TGFB2), while others are associated with immune responses (NFKBID, TNFRSF19) and neuronal functions (NTNG2, OPRL1, SIDT1).

3. A few proteins are transporters or involved in transport mechanisms (SLC17A9, SERAC1), and others have roles in protein modification and turnover (PSMA8, TTC9, TTC39C, TTL).

4. There are also proteins that are less characterized or have functions that are not well understood within the context of a specific biological process (IER5, KLLN, MSC, R3HDM4, SAMD10, SCYL3, SECTM1, ST3GAL1, TAS2R4, TAS2R20, WDR47, WDR86, ZBED6CL).

5. The taste receptors (TAS2R4, TAS2R20) and olfactory receptor (OR2A7) suggest sensory functions, which are not directly related to the other proteins in the list.

6. The presence of multiple zinc finger proteins (ZNF285, ZNF330, ZNF713) indicates a variety of DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory activities, but without a common target pathway or process.

Given the heterogeneity of the proteins and their respective functions, it is not possible to identify a unifying biological process that is prominently performed by this system of interacting proteins. Therefore, the most appropriate designation for this group is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the lack of a cohesive biological process among the proteins listed. The confidence score is 0.00, indicating the lowest confidence in the presence of a singular, prominent biological process within this system."	0.0	hair follicle development	GO:0001942	0.0887824365613906	3	97	35	TAS2R20,TENM2,WDR47	system of unrelated proteins	hair follicle development		0.023255813953488372	0.08571428571428572											False	False

The proteins AMPH, CPLX2, SNAP25, SNAP91, STX1B, SYN1, SYN2, SYP, SYT1, and SYT5 are all integral to synaptic transmission. They are involved in the docking, priming, and fusion of synaptic vesicles, as well as the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These proteins work in concert to ensure rapid and precise communication between neurons.

2. Proteins such as MAP2, MAPRE3, MAPT, and DCX are associated with microtubule stabilization and dynamics, which are crucial for neuronal structure, axonal transport, and the establishment of neuronal polarity during development and regeneration.

3. CAMKV, CNTN1, DCLK1, DPYSL5, EDIL3, GRIA2, HPCA, HPCAL1, L1CAM, LSAMP, NCALD, and VSNL1 are involved in neuronal signaling and plasticity. They participate in processes such as neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and calcium signaling, which are essential for learning, memory, and the overall function of neural networks.

4. CALB2, GNG2, and SNCB are calcium-binding proteins that regulate intracellular calcium levels, a key second messenger in various neuronal processes, including neurotransmitter release and gene expression.

5. ATP4A is a component of the proton pump responsible for acidifying the stomach. Its inclusion in this system may indicate a peripheral connection to neuronal control of gastric functions or may be an unrelated function.

6. DNAAF2 is known for its role in ciliary function and may be involved in the development of neuronal cilia or could be an outlier in this protein system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the development, structure, and function of neurons, particularly in the context of synaptic transmission and plasticity. The system reflects a complex network of proteins that work together to ensure proper neuronal communication, learning, and memory. The presence of a few proteins with less clear connections to neuronal function suggests additional peripheral roles or a minor degree of unrelated functions within the system."	0.95	vesicle-mediated transport in synapse	GO:0099003	1.973000355359184e-14	13	223	35	AMPH,CPLX2,ERC2,HPCA,SNAP25,SNAP91,SNCB,STX1B,SYN1,SYN2,SYP,SYT1,SYT5	neuronal development  and  synaptic function	vesicle-mediated transport in synapse	0.49763358	0.053061224489795916	0.37142857142857144	AMPH CPLX2 SNAP25 SNAP91 STX1B SYN1 SYN2 SYP SYT1 SYT5 MAP2 MAPRE3 MAPT DCX CAMKV CNTN1 DCLK1 DPYSL5 EDIL3 GRIA2 HPCA HPCAL1 L1CAM LSAMP NCALD VSNL1 CALB2 GNG2 SNCB	29.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided list are definitively associated with neuronal development and synaptic function.

BEGAIN, CAMSAP2, CEP170, CLASP1, and CLIP2 are proteins that interact with microtubules, which are components of the cytoskeleton. These proteins are involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules, as well as in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. CAMSAP2 anchors non-centrosomal microtubules to the cell cortex, while CLASP1 and CLIP2 regulate microtubule plus-end dynamics, influencing cell shape, polarity, and motility.

2. KIFC3 is a kinesin motor protein that moves along microtubules and is involved in intracellular transport, particularly in the transport of organelles and vesicles. It plays a role in the distribution of mitochondria and lysosomes within cells.

3. MARCKS is a protein that binds to actin filaments and is implicated in the cross-talk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. It is involved in cell motility, adhesion, and the formation of cellular protrusions.

4. NOP10 is a component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is involved in the processing and modification of rRNA. Although not directly related to cytoskeletal organization or intracellular transport, its interaction with the other proteins could be related to the localization of snoRNP complexes within the cell.

5. NT5C is a 5'-nucleotidase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular nucleotide levels and can indirectly affect various cellular processes, including signaling pathways that may influence cytoskeletal dynamics.

6. TRPV1 is a non-selective cation channel that responds to heat and inflammatory signals. It is primarily known for its role in sensory neurons but can also be expressed in non-neuronal tissues. Its interaction with the cytoskeletal proteins could be related to the regulation of cellular responses to stress or changes in the environment.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the organization, stabilization, and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, as well as in the intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles. The interactions between these proteins suggest a coordinated network that ensures proper cellular architecture and distribution of cellular components. While NOP10 and NT5C are not directly related to these processes, their inclusion in the system may reflect regulatory or localization roles that are yet to be fully understood. TRPV1's role in this context is less clear but may involve cellular stress responses that impact cytoskeletal dynamics."	0.85	cytoplasmic microtubule organization	GO:0031122	0.0011980331805086	3	60	9	CAMSAP2,CLASP1,CLIP2	cytoskeletal organization  and  intracellular transport	cytoplasmic microtubule organization	0.7642472	0.045454545454545456	0.3333333333333333	BEGAIN CAMSAP2 CEP170 CLASP1 CLIP2 KIFC3	6.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the organization, stabilization, and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, as well as intracellular transport.

Here is a brief analysis of the functional diversity within this system:

1. Several proteins in the list are involved in metabolic processes, but they do not share a common metabolic pathway. For example, MTHFR is involved in folate metabolism and homocysteine remethylation, while NUDT18 is a hydrolase that may play a role in the uridine and deoxycytidine salvage pathways.

2. Some proteins are implicated in cellular transport mechanisms, such as SLC2A6 and SLC43A2, which are solute carriers for different substrates, but they do not appear to be part of a coordinated transport system.

3. A few proteins have roles in the immune response, such as IFNG, which is a critical cytokine in innate and adaptive immunity, and TNFAIP2, which is involved in the inflammatory response. However, these proteins do not represent a unified aspect of immune function.

4. Proteins like MYBPC3 are involved in structural components of muscle tissue, while others like MATN1 and MATN4 are involved in extracellular matrix organization, indicating a diversity in structural and organizational roles.

5. There are also proteins with roles in signal transduction, such as SEMA4A, which is a semaphorin involved in axonal guidance, and RGL1, which is a Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator, but these do not form a coherent signaling pathway.

6. TP53I11 is related to the p53 signaling pathway, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, but it is not part of a larger, identifiable process within this protein system.

7. Other proteins have very specific and unique functions, such as OPRL1, which is an opioid receptor, and VOPP1, which is implicated in vesicular trafficking.

Given the lack of a unifying theme or biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins, it is appropriate to conclude that this system represents a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating that no single prominent biological process can be ascribed to this group of proteins."	0.0	negative regulation of adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway	GO:0106072	0.0471440486180662	2	10	29	MRAP2,OPRL1	system of unrelated proteins	adenylate cyclase-activating g protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway		0.05405405405405406	0.06896551724137931											False	True

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular functions, ranging from metabolism to signal transduction, and from gene regulation to structural support. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions:

1. Proteins such as ANKRD10, EML5, and the CECR2 are involved in structural and regulatory roles within the cell, but they do not share a common pathway or process.

2. APOA2 is associated with lipid metabolism and transport, while CYP4F22 is involved in fatty acid metabolism, yet these functions do not suggest a unified biological process within this system.

3. ARMCX5, BBS12, and C8orf37 are part of different complexes and pathways, including those related to ciliary function and transport, but again, they do not indicate a cohesive biological process.

4. Proteins like FFAR4 (a G-protein coupled receptor) and GNRHR (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor) are involved in signaling pathways, but they are not part of the same signaling cascade or physiological response.

5. Enzymes such as OPLAH and GPCPD1 have roles in metabolic processes, but these are not part of a singular metabolic pathway that defines the system.

6. The presence of various proteins with unclear or poorly characterized functions (e.g., C1orf56, C4orf36, C14orf28, C15orf62, FAM102A, FAM126B, FAM174B, FAM218A, FAM222B) further complicates the identification of a common biological process.

7. The diversity of chromosome locations (e.g., C1orf56 from chromosome 1, C4orf36 from chromosome 4) and the varied naming convention (e.g., ANKRD10, BBS12, GPR88) do not suggest a shared biological process or pathway.

In conclusion, the proteins listed do not exhibit a clear functional integration or a shared role in a specific biological process. The system appears to be a collection of unrelated proteins, each with its own distinct function within the cell. Therefore, the most appropriate name for the biological process performed by this system is ""System of unrelated proteins,"" and the confidence score is 0.00, indicating the lowest confidence in a unified biological process."	0.0	negative regulation of somatostatin secretion	GO:0090275	0.219825037844129	1	1	27	FAM218A	system of unrelated proteins	somatostatin secretion		0.037037037037037035	0.037037037037037035											False	False

MAGEL2 is a member of the MAGE family and is involved in intracellular trafficking and neurodevelopment. It has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy and endosomal sorting, particularly in neurons. Mutations in MAGEL2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting its critical role in these processes.

2. SNX5, SNX6, and SNX7 are part of the sorting nexin family. These proteins are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking. They play roles in the retromer complex, which is essential for the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. SNX5 and SNX6 have been shown to form a subcomplex that is implicated in the sorting of transmembrane proteins.

3. WASHC3 is a component of the WASH complex, which is involved in the actin-dependent process of endosomal sorting. It plays a role in the fission of tubules that serve as transport intermediates. The WASH complex is critical for the sorting of endosomal cargo and the recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane.

4. WDFY1 is a FYVE domain-containing protein that has been implicated in endosomal trafficking. It is involved in the early stages of autophagosome formation and may act as an adaptor protein that recruits other proteins to the endosome.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the processes of endosomal sorting and trafficking. They contribute to the proper distribution and recycling of cellular components, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental cues. The involvement of these proteins in the retromer complex and the WASH complex highlights their integrated roles in the endosomal system. The presence of MAGEL2 also suggests a specific importance in neuronal cells, potentially linking endosomal trafficking to neurodevelopmental processes."	0.91	endosomal transport	GO:0016197	9.115597874848778e-07	5	286	6	MAGEL2,SNX5,SNX6,SNX7,WASHC3	endosomal sorting  and  trafficking	endosomal transport	0.8152017	0.017421602787456445	0.8333333333333334	MAGEL2 SNX5 SNX6 SNX7 WASHC3 WDFY1	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Endosomal Sorting and Trafficking"" as all listed genes are definitively involved in endosomal sorting, trafficking, and related processes.

MGMT, also known as O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, is involved in the direct repair of alkylated DNA. It removes mutagenic and cytotoxic adducts from the O-6 position of guanine, thereby preventing erroneous base pairing and mutations.

2. MUTYH is a base excision repair enzyme that recognizes and excises oxidatively damaged DNA bases like 8-oxoguanine, which can mispair with adenine, leading to mutations during replication if left unrepaired.

3. TDP1, or tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, functions in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks containing a 3'-end blocking lesion and is particularly important for the resolution of topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes.

4. SLX4IP interacts with SLX4, a structure-specific endonuclease subunit, which is involved in the repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks and in the maintenance of telomeres in association with the telomere maintenance complex.

5. HUS1B is a component of the 9-1-1 cell cycle checkpoint response complex that plays a critical role in DNA damage response and repair as well as maintaining genomic stability.

6. HPRT1, or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1, while primarily known for its role in the purine salvage pathway, also has a role in maintaining genomic integrity by participating in DNA repair.

7. PARN, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease, is involved in the control of mRNA stability and has been implicated in the regulation of DNA repair mRNA transcripts, influencing the DNA damage response.

8. RRAD, Ras-related associated with diabetes, is a small GTPase that may be involved in the cellular stress response, although its role in DNA repair is not well characterized.

9. SAPCD1 (suppressor APC domain containing 1), DOCK9 (dedicator of cytokinesis 9), C10orf88 (chromosome 10 open reading frame 88), THUMPD1 (THUMP domain containing 1), WDCP (WD repeat and coiled-coil containing), and ZBTB14 (zinc finger and BTB domain containing 14) are proteins with less clearly defined roles in DNA repair or genomic stability, but they may contribute to these processes through indirect mechanisms or as part of larger protein complexes.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly or indirectly involved in the recognition, signaling, and repair of DNA damage, as well as the maintenance of genomic stability. The interplay between these proteins ensures the integrity of the genome is preserved, preventing mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer. The presence of several key DNA repair enzymes and associated factors suggests a coordinated network focused on safeguarding the cell's genetic information."	0.85	guanine salvage	GO:0006178	0.0427917192245845	1	1	11	HPRT1	dna repair  and  genome stability maintenance	guanine salvage	0.51132995	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	MGMT MUTYH TDP1 SLX4IP HUS1B	5.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are directly involved in DNA repair mechanisms or the maintenance of genomic stability.

CEP41 is a centrosomal protein that plays a role in microtubule organization. It is implicated in ciliogenesis and may be involved in the Joubert syndrome, a disorder affecting the development of the cerebellum and brainstem.

2. DPP4, also known as CD26, is a serine exopeptidase that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. It is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism by inactivating incretins like GLP-1, and it also plays a role in immune regulation.

3. IQCG is associated with the regulation of the calcium channel activity in sperm. It is involved in sperm motility and may play a role in male fertility.

4. ITSN1 is an adaptor protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular signaling. It has a role in synaptic vesicle cycling and may influence neurotransmitter release.

5. NFATC4, or Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 4, is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to signals that increase intracellular calcium. It plays a role in the immune response and cardiac hypertrophy.

6. PDP1, Pyruvate dehyrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 1, is involved in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle.

7. PIP5K1C synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a precursor of secondary messengers involved in signaling pathways, including those regulating cell growth, shape, and motility.

8. PLCD1 encodes phospholipase C delta 1, which hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), involved in calcium signaling and protein kinase C activation.

The KRTAP (Keratin Associated Protein) family members, including KRTAP2-4, KRTAP4-4, KRTAP4-11, KRTAP5-3, KRTAP5-6, KRTAP9-8, KRTAP10-3, and KRTAP10-7, are a group of proteins that are associated with the keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. They contribute to the formation of the hair shaft by determining its shape and rigidity. These proteins are rich in cysteine, which allows for the formation of disulfide bonds, leading to the highly cross-linked and resilient structure of hair keratin.

2. The LCE (Late Cornified Envelope) proteins, including LCE3A, LCE3B, LCE3C, and LCE4A, are expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis. They are involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a structure that provides a barrier to protect against environmental stressors, pathogens, and water loss. The LCE proteins are thought to play a role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which is a critical process in maintaining skin integrity and function.

3. SSC4D (Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen Recognized by T Cells 4D) is less directly related to the structural components of hair and skin but may be involved in immune responses in the skin. It is a serine protease inhibitor that can be overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting a role in the regulation of protease activity during skin pathology.

To summarize, the majority of the genes in this set encode proteins that are directly involved in the structural integrity and formation of hair and the epidermal barrier.

Upon analysis of the functions and interactions of these proteins, it becomes apparent that they are involved in a wide array of biological processes without a single, prominent biological process that encompasses the majority of them. The proteins listed are implicated in various cellular functions such as lipid transport (ABCA5), neurotransmitter signaling (ADRA1B), apoptosis (AIF1L, AIFM2), DNA repair (ALKBH6), cytoskeletal organization (ANKRD20A1, ARHGAP22, ARHGAP42), metabolism (ASAH2, ASAH2B), vasopressin signaling (AVP), cell division (CENPE), sphingolipid metabolism (CERS1), fibroblast growth factor signaling (FGF11, FGF12), and many others.

LYST, or lysosomal trafficking regulator, is involved in the regulation of lysosomal size and morphology. It plays a role in the sorting and trafficking of endosomal cargo destined for lysosomes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organelle function.

2. NRDE2 is less characterized but is thought to be involved in nuclear RNAi and may play a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, potentially influencing the stability or localization of specific mRNA transcripts.

3. REN, also known as renin, is primarily involved in blood pressure control and electrolyte balance. It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is not directly related to endosomal sorting but may be affected by vesicular trafficking processes.

4. SNRPA1 is a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein that is part of the spliceosome complex. It is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a process that occurs in the nucleus and is not directly related to endosomal sorting.

5. SNX6, SNX7, and SNX12 are members of the sorting nexin family. These proteins are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, playing roles in the retromer complex, which is responsible for the retrograde transport of cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.

6. SORT1, or sortilin, functions in the sorting of proteins to the lysosomes. It is involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes and may also play a role in neurotrophic signaling and apoptosis.

7. TMEM9, TMEM123, and TMEM189 are transmembrane proteins with less well-characterized functions. However, transmembrane proteins often play roles in cellular transport and signaling, potentially contributing to the trafficking system.

8. WASHC3 is part of the WASH complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting and the regulation of actin polymerization. It plays a role in the fission of transport intermediates from the endosomes.

9. WDFY1 is a WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein that is implicated in endosomal sorting and signaling pathways, potentially acting as an adaptor in the endosomal system.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are involved in the processes of endosomal sorting and trafficking, which are essential for the proper distribution and degradation of cellular components. While not all proteins are directly linked to this process, the preponderance of sorting nexins and related proteins suggests a strong functional theme. The presence of proteins like REN and SNRPA1, which are not directly related to endosomal sorting, slightly lowers the confidence score. However, the overall function of the system appears to be centered on the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and the regulation of cargo sorting and trafficking within the cell."	0.85	endosomal transport	GO:0016197	3.35040078470048e-06	6	286	12	LYST,SNX6,SNX7,SNX12,SORT1,WASHC3	endosomal sorting  and  trafficking	endosomal transport	0.8152017	0.02054794520547945	0.5	LYST SNX6 SNX7 SNX12 SORT1 WASHC3 WDFY1	7.0	-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, as indicated by definite assertions in the text.

ACVR1B (Activin A receptor type-1B), ACVR1C (Activin A receptor type-1C), and ACVR2A (Activin A receptor type-2A) are receptors that belong to the TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-beta) superfamily. These receptors are involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. They are serine/threonine kinase receptors that mediate the cellular responses to members of the TGF-β superfamily such as activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).

2. ARHGAP29 is a GTPase-activating protein that negatively regulates Rho GTPases, which are involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. Rho GTPases are also known to interact with TGF-β signaling, suggesting a potential modulatory role of ARHGAP29 in this pathway.

3. GDF11 (Growth Differentiation Factor 11) and NBL1 (neuroblastoma 1, DAN family BMP antagonist) are members of the TGF-β superfamily. GDF11 has been shown to regulate anterior-posterior patterning and to modulate aging and regeneration processes. NBL1 acts as an antagonist in the TGF-β signaling pathway, which can modulate the activity of TGF-β family ligands.

4. TWSG1 (Twisted gastrulation BMP signaling modulator 1) is another protein that modulates BMP signaling, a branch of the TGF-β pathway. It can either enhance or inhibit BMP signaling depending on the context and the presence of other interacting proteins.

5. The remaining proteins, such as C17orf53, C18orf54, CCDC28B, CERK, CLEC1A, CNGB1, DCAF17, DNAJC27, and SYNJ2BP, do not have well-established direct roles in the TGF-β signaling pathway based on the current knowledge. However, they may contribute to the broader regulatory network that influences TGF-β signaling indirectly or in a context-dependent manner.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly or indirectly involved in the modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for a wide range of cellular processes, and its precise regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The proteins ACVR1B, ACVR1C, ACVR2A, GDF11, NBL1, and TWSG1 have clear roles in this pathway, while others like ARHGAP29 may modulate it through their effects on Rho GTPases.

GYG1 and GYG2 are glycogenin proteins that serve as the core upon which glycogen synthase (GYS1) can begin glycogen synthesis. GYG1 and GYG2 are involved in the autoglucosylation that initiates glycogen granule formation, while GYS1 extends the glycogen molecule by adding glucose units.

2. PPP1R3C, PPP1R10, PPP1R11, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, and PPP1R37 are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1 is a major enzyme that dephosphorylates glycogen synthase, activating it for glycogen synthesis, and glycogen phosphorylase, inactivating it to stop glycogen breakdown. These regulatory subunits target PP1 to specific subcellular locations and modulate its activity towards specific substrates, including those involved in glycogen metabolism.

3. UGP2 encodes for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2, an enzyme that produces UDP-glucose, a direct precursor for glycogen synthesis. This links the protein to glycogen metabolism as well.

4. AATK, LMTK2, SH3RF2, and SHOC2 are involved in signal transduction pathways that can influence cell survival, apoptosis, and possibly metabolic processes, although their direct roles in glycogen metabolism are not as clear as the other proteins mentioned.

5. CLOCK is a core component of the circadian clock, which regulates rhythms in physiology and behavior, including glucose metabolism. It forms a heterodimer with BMAL1 and regulates the transcription of various clock-controlled genes.

6. CIPC, TOX4, and ZFYVE16 are associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms and may indirectly influence metabolic processes through the modulation of circadian-controlled genes.

7. CNST, CSRNP1, PEAK1, PHACTR1, PHACTR3, PPP1R10, TPRN, and ZFYVE9 are proteins with diverse functions, including roles in cytoskeletal organization, RNA splicing, and signal transduction. Their direct involvement in glycogen metabolism or circadian regulation is not well established based on current knowledge.

To summarize, a significant number of proteins in this system are directly involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, with a subset also linked to the circadian regulation of metabolic processes. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated regulation of glucose homeostasis that is influenced by the circadian clock, which could have implications for understanding diseases such as diabetes where both glycogen metabolism and circadian rhythms are disrupted. The confidence score reflects the strong but not exclusive representation of these processes within the system."	0.85	glucan biosynthetic process	GO:0009250	5.366670898718067e-07	5	45	24	GYG1,GYG2,GYS1,PPP1R3C,UGP2	glycogen metabolism  and glucose homeostasis	glucan biosynthetic process	0.5144495	0.078125	0.20833333333333334	GYG1 GYG2 GYS1 PPP1R3C PPP1R10 PPP1R11 PPP1R13L PPP1R15A PPP1R37 UGP2 CLOCK	11.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Glycogen Metabolism and Circadian Regulation of Glucose Homeostasis"" due to the clear involvement of several genes in glycogen metabolism and the regulation of circadian rhythms, which are crucial for glucose homeostasis.||||-- Explanation --||GYG1: High||GYG1 is directly involved in the initiation of glycogen granule formation through autoglucosylation, supporting glycogen metabolism.||||GYG2: High||GYG2, like GYG1, is involved in the autoglucosylation that initiates glycogen granule formation, supporting glycogen metabolism.||||GYS1: High||GYS1 extends the glycogen molecule by adding glucose units, directly supporting glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R3C: High||PPP1R3C is a regulatory subunit of PP1, which dephosphorylates and activates glycogen synthase, supporting glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R10: High||PPP1R10 is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R11: High||PPP1R11 is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R13L: High||PPP1R13L is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R15A: High||PPP1R15A is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||PPP1R37: High||PPP1R37 is a regulatory subunit of PP1, involved in the dephosphorylation of enzymes critical for glycogen metabolism.||||UGP2: High||UGP2 produces UDP-glucose, a direct precursor for glycogen synthesis, supporting glycogen metabolism.||||CLOCK: High||CLOCK is a core component of the circadian clock, regulating rhythms in physiology and behavior, including glucose metabolism.||||CIPC: Medium||CIPC is associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms, which may influence metabolic processes.||||TOX4: Medium||TOX4 is associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms, which may influence metabolic processes.||||ZFYVE16: Medium||ZFYVE16 is associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms, which may influence metabolic processes.||||-- genes supporting the name: GYG1, GYG2, GYS1, PPP1R3C, PPP1R10, PPP1R11, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, PPP1R37, UGP2, CLOCK, CIPC, TOX4, ZFYVE16||-- genes supporting the name with confidence = High: GYG1, GYG2, GYS1, PPP1R3C, PPP1R10, PPP1R11, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, PPP1R37, UGP2, CLOCK"	25.0	0.44	glucose homeostasis	GO:0042593	DBH GCG GCK ASPSCR1 PLSCR3 SGCB IGFBP5 FOXO3 OPRK1 TREM2 ADRA2A SESN3 PIK3R2 MPC2 MCU GPX1 SMARCB1 SLC39A14 PCK2 UBTF FFAR2 HNF4A UCP2 STX4 VSNL1 XBP1 WFS1 CEBPA KCNJ11 CDK16 NR1D1 ADIPOR2 GPER1 SLC30A8 ZBTB20 UNC13B CCN4 AKT1 GPR21 ACE PDX1 HLA-DRB1 ALOX5 MTNR1B NME1-NME2 SUCNR1 AGER PARK7 CPB2 SLC29A1 NUCKS1 CYP11B1 ADIPOQ CCDC186 NDUFAF2 CMKLR2 DHPS PDK2 HK2 CARTPT PRKACA PAX2 PPP3CA NPTX1 TRPM4 GCGR ENY2 HK3 LIN28A NME2 GPI SIRT1 TSC22D4 PFKM NR1H4 BHLHA15 FOXK1 G6PC1 PRKCE GATA4 NADK PTPRN2 LEP TRA2B PPP1R3G BAD FGFR4 NKX6-1 GPR27 DUSP29 LRP5 ZBED6 PDK4 TCF7L2 RPTOR PLA2G6 OAS1 CFTR C1QTNF12 SLC2A4 PTPN2 PIH1D1 HK1 INSR SLC12A6 IGF1R OGT CYB5R4 PTCH1 JAGN1 INPP5K MLXIPL PPARG PYGL SLC12A7 RPS6 RAB11FIP5 PTPN11 ANO1 SLC16A1 GPLD1 SIDT2 OSBP STXBP4 PPARGC1A RAB11B EFNA5 RAF1 KCNB1 ACSM2A KAT5 GCLC PAX6 NGFR FGF21 USF1 PIK3CA NCOA5 SOX4 FABP5 FOXO1 CMA1 IRS2 SRI ADCY8 VGF OBP2A GJB6 FOXA2 NOX4 RBP4 FKBP1B HNF1A NEUROD1 HKDC1 STAT3 DYNLL1 TH PCK1 TRPV4 ICAM1 EPHA5 RMI1 CASR STK11 RAB11FIP2 CNR1 IL6 INS FFAR1 ADISSP HIF1A ADCY5 TIAM1 LRRC8A RACK1 TWNK CRY2 PIM3 BGLAP SYBU CYP7A1 ABCA12 SRF SIN3A FOXA1 PIK3R1 ERN1 BAIAP3 FOXA3 PRKAA2 CLTRN POMC CSRP3 GPR68 RRAGA IRS1 SLC9B2 SIRT6 ADGRF5 CRH ADIPOR1 SLC8B1 GCLM MBD5 KLF7 CRTC2 NCF1 SERPINF1 GCKR ZNF236 CRY1 PRKAA1 APPL2 RBM4 BRSK2 RFX6 PTPRN LEPR G6PC2 C2CD2L SMARCA4 CAV3 BACE2 LRRC8D SLC2A2 GHRL CSMD1 GAS6 ABCC8 SESN2 FOXK2 KLF15 STXBP3 SMAD4 PRCP RPH3AL SELENOT PDE8B FOSL2 PPP3CB	241.0	0.0413533834586466	True	True

The proteins ABHD13, APLF, APTX, CHD1L, GADD45G, H2AFY, H2AFY2, HPF1, LIG4, MACROD1, NHEJ1, NSUN6, PARP3, PGBD4, PURB, TTC5, XPC, and XRCC4 are involved in various aspects of DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. These proteins function in detecting DNA damage, signaling its presence, and facilitating repair through multiple pathways, including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and non-homologous end joining.

2. LIG4, XRCC4, and NHEJ1 are key components of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. LIG4 is a ligase that, together with XRCC4, seals the DNA ends, while NHEJ1 (also known as XLF) stabilizes the DNA ends for processing.

3. APTX, GADD45G, and PARP3 are associated with base excision repair (BER). APTX resolves DNA single-strand breaks, a common type of damage. GADD45G is involved in the recognition and signaling of DNA damage, while PARP3 is implicated in DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic stability.

4. XPC is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), recognizing and initiating the repair of helix-distorting DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV light.

5. CHD1L, H2AFY, and H2AFY2 are chromatin remodelers or histone variants that modulate the accessibility of DNA to repair proteins. CHD1L has ATPase activity and is implicated in the relaxation of chromatin structure during DNA repair.

6. Proteins such as CETN2 and HAP1, while not directly involved in DNA repair, may influence the process through their roles in cell cycle regulation and intracellular trafficking, respectively.

7. The proteins PURB and EHF are transcription factors that could potentially regulate the expression of genes involved in DNA repair or the cellular response to DNA damage.

The majority of the proteins listed, such as ALKBH7, ATP5E, ATP5J2, COX5B, COX7C, MRPL27, MRPL43, MRPL51, MRPL52, MRPL54, NDUFA2, NDUFA11, NDUFA13, NDUFB2, NDUFB8, and UQCR11, are directly involved in mitochondrial function. These proteins are components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes or are involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. They play critical roles in ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, a process essential for energy generation in eukaryotic cells.

2. Several proteins, including C19orf43, C19orf53, NEDD8, NGDN, NOP10, ROMO1, and WDR83OS, are less characterized but are associated with mitochondrial function or regulation. For example, NEDD8 is known for its role in protein modification and may influence mitochondrial dynamics or function indirectly.

3. Proteins such as RPL11, RPL18A, RPL24, RPL35A, SNRPB, SNRPC, SRP14, and UBL5 are involved in protein synthesis. They are components of the ribosome, the spliceosome, or the signal recognition particle, all of which are essential for the translation and proper targeting of proteins. These proteins contribute to the overall protein synthesis machinery within the cell, ensuring that proteins are accurately synthesized and processed.

4. PSMA4 and PSMA7 are components of the proteasome, a complex involved in protein degradation. The proteasome maintains protein homeostasis within the cell by degrading misfolded or damaged proteins, thus indirectly supporting the efficiency of mitochondrial function and protein synthesis.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in mitochondrial function, including ATP production and mitochondrial protein synthesis, as well as cytoplasmic protein synthesis. The interplay between these proteins ensures the cell's energy demands are met and that proteins are synthesized, processed, and degraded correctly. The system reflects a functional integration of energy production and protein homeostasis, which are fundamental to cellular survival and function."	0.92	oxidative phosphorylation	GO:0006119	1.8430492988329507e-10	9	145	30	ATP5F1E,ATP5MF,C19orf53,COX5B,MRPL54,NDUFA2,NDUFA11,NDUFA13,SRP14	mitochondrial function  and  protein synthesis	oxidative phosphorylation	0.5246314	0.05421686746987952	0.3	ALKBH7 ATP5E ATP5J2 COX5B COX7C MRPL27 MRPL43 MRPL51 MRPL52 MRPL54 NDUFA2 NDUFA11 NDUFA13 NDUFB2 NDUFB8 UQCR11 RPL11 RPL18A RPL24 RPL35A SNRPB SNRPC SRP14 UBL5 PSMA4 PSMA7	26.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided list are directly involved in mitochondrial function, including ATP production and mitochondrial protein synthesis, or are components of the protein synthesis machinery.

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:

1. FMN1, KIAA1161, LRRC42, MEGF9, MFSD9, NIPAL3, PIGW, PPIP5K1, RNF44, RNF121, SCAPER, SFT2D1, SNX30, SPIDR, ZFYVE1, and ZNF513 are all proteins with diverse roles ranging from intracellular signaling to structural functions. They do not share a common process that dominates their collective biological activities.

2. HPS1 is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, which is a specialized process not directly related to the functions of the majority of the other proteins listed.

3. HS6ST1 is a heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase, which modifies heparan sulfate proteoglycans, a process distinct from the functions of the other proteins.

4. IPPK, PDP2, and SLC35A4 are involved in metabolic pathways, but they do not share a common metabolic function that would define the system.

5. KCNS1 and SLC9A7 are ion transporters, but they transport different ions and are involved in different physiological processes.

6. NR1H4 is a nuclear receptor involved in bile acid signaling, which is a specific regulatory pathway not prominently represented among the other proteins.

7. NUDT22, RNASEL, and SOCS4 are involved in nucleotide metabolism, antiviral response, and cytokine signaling, respectively, each representing distinct cellular processes.

8. SLC18B1, SLC39A9 are transporters, but they are involved in the transport of different substrates.

9. ZNF2 is a zinc finger protein, which suggests a role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, but it does not form a coherent functional group with the other proteins.

Given the diversity of functions and lack of a unifying biological process, the most accurate description for this system of interacting proteins is a ""System of unrelated proteins."" The confidence score is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in a single, prominent biological process that characterizes the system as a whole."	0.0	nitrogen catabolite activation of transcription	GO:0090294	0.0830440777899018	1	1	28	NIPAL3	system of unrelated proteins	nitrogen catabolite activation of transcription		0.03571428571428571	0.03571428571428571											False	False

The histone proteins HIST1H2AI, HIST1H2AM, HIST1H3F, HIST1H4A, and HIST1H4K are core components of nucleosomes, which are the fundamental units of chromatin structure. These proteins play a critical role in the packaging of DNA into chromatin, regulating DNA accessibility for transcription, DNA repair, and replication processes. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, are known to affect chromatin structure and function, influencing gene expression patterns.

2. PTMS, parathymosin, is involved in chromatin remodeling and may play a role in the process of transcriptional regulation. It is known to interact with histones, suggesting a role in chromatin structure modulation.

3. ZNF236, a zinc finger protein, is likely involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are often associated with chromatin modification and remodeling, suggesting that ZNF236 may contribute to the regulation of gene expression through interaction with chromatin.

4. TP53I13, a p53 inducible protein, may be involved in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage, potentially through pathways that include chromatin modification and remodeling as part of the DNA damage response.

5. The presence of other proteins such as ABHD16B, CUZD1, DGCR6, FAM24B, ITGAE, ITPRIPL1, MAMDC4, ME3, NUDT3, OCLM, PRR22, QPCTL, RHBDD3, RNFT2, SLC29A2, ST20, SYCE1L, TCTEX1D2, TMEM138, TMEM183A, TMEM243, TMSB15B, and ZNRF1, which do not have a clear or direct connection to chromatin organization or modification, suggests that this system of proteins may also be involved in other biological processes. However, the presence of multiple histone proteins and proteins associated with chromatin remodeling indicates a significant emphasis on chromatin organization and modification.

To summarize, while the system of interacting proteins includes a diverse array of functions, a prominent theme is the involvement in chromatin organization and modification. This is supported by the presence of multiple histone proteins and other proteins that interact with chromatin or are implicated in transcriptional regulation. However, the confidence score is not a full 1.00 due to the presence of other proteins with functions that are not clearly related to chromatin organization, which may indicate additional biological processes at play."	0.85	guanine transport	GO:0015854	0.0947940797802162	1	4	22	QPCTL	chromatin organization  and  modification	guanine transport	0.24390067	0.04	0.045454545454545456	HIST1H2AI HIST1H2AM HIST1H3F HIST1H4A HIST1H4K PTMS	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set ""Chromatin Organization and Modification"" is supported by multiple genes that are directly involved in chromatin structure and function.

NeST	Cluster2-146	Cluster2-146	BBC3 CC2D1A PMAIP1	BBC3 CC2D1A PMAIP1	3	Apoptotic Signaling Pathway	"1. BBC3, also known as PUMA, is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. It is involved in p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis triggered by various stimuli, including DNA damage and growth factor deprivation. BBC3 acts by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, neutralizing their protective effect and thus promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is a critical step in apoptosis.

2. PMAIP1, known as NOXA, is another pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Similar to BBC3, it is implicated in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is regulated by p53. PMAIP1 preferentially binds to MCL1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and targets it for proteasomal degradation, thereby tipping the balance towards apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

3. CC2D1A is a transcriptional co-regulator that has been implicated in neural development and is known to interact with the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A. While its direct role in apoptosis is less clear compared to BBC3 and PMAIP1, it has been associated with signaling pathways that can influence cell survival and apoptosis indirectly.

The proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. BBC3 and PMAIP1 are direct effectors of apoptosis, promoting cell death in response to stress signals. CC2D1A's role is less direct, but it may modulate apoptotic signaling through its interactions with other proteins. The majority of the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into the process of apoptosis, with a strong emphasis on the regulation of cell death through the intrinsic pathway."	0.9	positive regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway	GO:1902237	0.000242423196898	2	11	3	BBC3,PMAIP1	apoptotic signaling pathway	endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway	0.63496995	0.16666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	BBC3 PMAIP1	2.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Apoptotic Signaling Pathway"" as two of the three genes (BBC3 and PMAIP1) are directly involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, promoting cell death in response to stress signals.

BTBD2, CUL4B, DCAF6, DCAF10, DCAF11, DCAF16, RNF7, and ZER1 are components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). They are involved in the targeted degradation of proteins through ubiquitination, which is a post-translational modification where ubiquitin proteins are attached to a substrate protein, marking it for degradation by the proteasome. CUL4B is a core component of the cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which recruits substrates through specific adaptors such as DCAF proteins. RNF7 acts as a ring finger protein that can enhance the ubiquitination activity of the complex.

2. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that has a well-established role in the regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor, thus participating in cell cycle control and apoptosis. It can also be involved in the UPS through its ubiquitin ligase activity.

3. SENP3 is a SUMO-specific protease involved in the deSUMOylation process, which can indirectly affect ubiquitination pathways by altering the SUMOylation status of proteins that are also targets for ubiquitination.

4. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins and the stabilization of a number of client proteins, many of which are involved in signal transduction and protection against stress. It can interact with the UPS by stabilizing proteins before they are ubiquitinated or by refolding ubiquitinated proteins that have been targeted for degradation.

5. TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction. It can influence the UPS by promoting the degradation of IκB, leading to the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses.

6. UBXN1 and UBXN7 are members of the UBX domain-containing protein family, which can interact with the p97/VCP segregase, a protein involved in the extraction of ubiquitinated proteins from membranes or protein complexes in preparation for their degradation by the proteasome.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein quality control, regulation of cell cycle, and various signaling pathways. Additionally, they play roles in the cellular stress response, particularly in the context of protein folding and inflammation. The system exhibits a high degree of functional integration, with multiple proteins contributing to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, as well as the regulation of these processes through chaperoning and deSUMOylation."	0.89	protein modification by small protein conjugation or removal	GO:0070647	1.2350689606151512e-07	10	970	15	CUL4B,DCAF6,DCAF10,DCAF11,DCAF16,HSP90AA1,MDM2,RNF7,SENP3,UBXN1	ubiquitin-proteasome system regulation  and  cellular stress response	protein modification by small protein conjugation or removal	0.4201282	0.010256410256410256	0.6666666666666666	BTBD2 CUL4B DCAF6 DCAF10 DCAF11 DCAF16 RNF7 ZER1 MDM2 UBXN1 UBXN7	11.0	"-- Summary --||The majority of the genes in the provided set are involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and cellular stress response.

ARHGAP21 is a GTPase-activating protein that interacts with the small GTPase Cdc42, which is involved in various cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton organization, cell shape, and cell migration. ARHGAP21 has been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion and may indirectly influence gene expression by modulating the cytoskeleton and cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix.

2. CDC27 is a core component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a large E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates various stages of the cell cycle. The APC/C is crucial for the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis and the exit from mitosis into the G1 phase. It targets cell cycle regulators such as cyclins and securin for proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling cell cycle transitions.

3. CTNNA2 encodes alpha-catenin, a protein that links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton in adherens junctions, which are important for cell-cell adhesion. While its primary role is structural, it can also influence signaling pathways that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation.

4. HDAC1 is a histone deacetylase involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. By removing acetyl groups from histone tails, HDAC1 condenses chromatin structure, which generally suppresses gene expression. It can also deacetylate non-histone proteins, affecting their function and stability.

5. SOX2 is a transcription factor critical for maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. It regulates gene expression programs that are essential for self-renewal and can also influence cell fate decisions during development. SOX2 has been shown to interact with chromatin-modifying enzymes, including HDAC1, to regulate gene expression.

6. USP7, also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can remove ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby preventing their degradation by the proteasome. It has several substrates, including p53 and MDM2, which are key regulators of the cell cycle and apoptosis. USP7 can modulate chromatin structure indirectly through its regulation of histone ubiquitination.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression (HDAC1, SOX2), as well as the progression and regulation of the cell cycle (CDC27, USP7). ARHGAP21 and CTNNA2, while primarily associated with cytoskeletal and cell adhesion functions, can indirectly influence gene expression and cell proliferation. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated role in ensuring proper cell cycle progression and maintaining the integrity of gene expression programs, particularly in contexts where cell adhesion and chromatin structure are dynamically regulated."	0.85	myofibroblast cell apoptotic process	GO:1904516	0.0298302673774556	1	2	6	SOX2	chromatin structure  and  cell cycle progression	myofibroblast cell apoptotic process	0.29583892	0.14285714285714285	0.16666666666666666	HDAC1 SOX2 CDC27 USP7	4.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set ""Regulation of Chromatin Structure and Cell Cycle Progression"" is supported by the functions of HDAC1, SOX2, CDC27, and USP7.

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:

1. BAALC is associated with hematopoiesis and has been implicated in leukemia. It does not share a direct functional pathway with the majority of the other proteins listed.

2. HRH3 is a histamine receptor involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in the brain, which is functionally distinct from hematopoiesis or other processes listed.

3. IFNG is a cytokine critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumor control, diverging from the roles of neurotransmitter regulation or hematopoiesis.

4. KCNS2 is a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, which modulates electrical signaling in neurons, again differing from immune function or hematopoiesis.

5. LOXHD1 is involved in the functioning of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the hair cells in the ear, which is unrelated to the aforementioned processes.

ACTB and ACTG1 are both cytoskeletal proteins that form the microfilament system of the cytoskeleton. They are involved in providing structural support, enabling cell motility, and are implicated in various cellular processes such as cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, and the establishment of cell junctions.

2. TUBB3 is a class III beta-tubulin, a component of microtubules, which are part of the cytoskeleton and play critical roles in maintaining cell shape, intracellular transport, and cell division. TUBB3 is particularly important in neurons and is involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system.

3. MAPRE1, also known as EB1, is a microtubule-associated protein that interacts with the plus ends of microtubules and is involved in microtubule dynamics, mitosis, and cell migration. It also plays a role in anchoring microtubules to centrosomes and other microtubule-organizing centers.

4. CKAP5, also known as ch-TOG or XMAP215, is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and is involved in spindle formation during mitosis. It is essential for proper chromosome segregation and cell division.

5. ATP6V1B2 is a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, an essential process for intracellular trafficking, protein degradation, and organelle function.

6. PSMD1 is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, which is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The proteasome plays a pivotal role in maintaining protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular function.

7. HDAC6 is a histone deacetylase that has a broader substrate specificity and is involved in the deacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tubulin. It is implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and also plays a role in cellular stress responses by coordinating the aggresome pathway, which sequesters misfolded proteins.

8. HSPA1B is a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, which acts as molecular chaperones facilitating the folding of newly synthesized proteins, the refolding of misfolded proteins, and the degradation of proteins that can no longer be salvaged. It is also involved in protecting cells from stress.

9. EEF1A1 is an elongation factor that plays a central role in the elongation step during protein synthesis by the ribosome. It is also known to interact with actin and the cytoskeleton and has been implicated in various non-canonical functions, including apoptosis and the cellular stress response.

10. TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction. It is also involved in the regulation of immune cells and can induce apoptotic cell death, inflammation, and inhibit tumorigenesis.

11. EML1 is a microtubule-associated protein that contributes to the stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton and is involved in cell division and the proper formation of the mitotic spindle.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the dynamics of the cytoskeleton and the cellular stress response. The cytoskeletal proteins (ACTB, ACTG1, TUBB3, MAPRE1, CKAP5, EEF1A1, EML1) are crucial for maintaining cell structure, division, and intracellular transport. The stress response proteins (HDAC6, HSPA1B, PSMD1, TNF) are essential for protein homeostasis, cellular recovery from stress, and the immune response. The system reflects a functional integration of cytoskeletal organization and cellular stress mechanisms, which are critical for cell survival and adaptation to environmental challenges."	0.85	cytoskeleton organization	GO:0007010	1.4952344834241707e-05	9	1512	12	ACTB,ACTG1,CKAP5,EML1,HDAC6,HSPA1B,MAPRE1,TNF,TUBB3	cytoskeletal dynamics  and  cellular stress response	cytoskeleton organization	0.6857227	0.005940594059405941	0.75	ACTB ACTG1 TUBB3 MAPRE1 CKAP5 EML1 HDAC6 HSPA1B PSMD1 TNF	10.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set ""Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Cellular Stress Response"" is well-supported by the provided genes.

GYG1 (Glycogenin-1) and GYS1 (Glycogen Synthase 1) are directly involved in glycogen synthesis. GYG1 acts as a primer for glycogen synthesis, initiating the core structure to which glucose residues are added. GYS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, responsible for the elongation of the glycogen chain by adding glucose units.

2. PPP1R3B (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3B) and PPP1R3C (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3C) are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase, thus promoting glycogen synthesis. PPP1R3B is known to be specific for the liver and PPP1R3C for skeletal muscle, indicating tissue-specific regulation of glycogen metabolism.

3. PPP1R11 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Inhibitor Subunit 11) and PPP1R37 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 37) are also associated with PP1, but their precise roles in glycogen metabolism are less clear. They may modulate the activity of PP1 in different contexts, potentially influencing glycogen storage or mobilization.

4. AATK (Apoptosis-Associated Tyrosine Kinase) and LMTK2 (Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2) are kinases that could be involved in signaling pathways that indirectly affect glycogen metabolism, although their direct roles in this process are not well established.

5. SNCAIP (Synuclein Alpha Interacting Protein) has been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and may have indirect effects on glycogen metabolism through neuronal signaling pathways.

6. The remaining proteins, such as C2orf74, C20orf27, CBARP, CCDC85B, CNST, CSRNP1, CSRNP2, ERBIN, NHLRC1, NNAT, PHACTR3, and the ZFYVE family members, do not have well-established roles in glycogen metabolism. Their inclusion in this analysis is based on less direct evidence or potential regulatory interactions that have yet to be fully characterized.

In summary, the primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of glycogen metabolism, with a focus on glycogen synthesis. The system includes key enzymes directly responsible for glycogen synthesis, regulatory subunits that modulate the activity of these enzymes, and additional proteins that may influence glycogen metabolism through signaling pathways or indirect interactions. The confidence score reflects the fact that while several proteins in the system are directly involved in glycogen metabolism, others have less clear roles or are involved in broader regulatory functions that may only peripherally impact this process."	0.85	glucan biosynthetic process	GO:0009250	1.0460489634640745e-07	5	45	19	ERBIN,GYG1,LMTK2,PHACTR3,PPP1R3B	glycogen metabolism  and  regulation	glucan biosynthetic process	0.49767908	0.0847457627118644	0.2631578947368421	GYG1 GYS1 PPP1R3B PPP1R3C	4.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Glycogen Metabolism and Regulation"" due to the presence of key enzymes and regulatory subunits directly involved in glycogen synthesis and metabolism.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in two main biological processes: signal transduction, particularly through the TGF-beta/SMAD and MAPK/ERK pathways, and protein folding, with a focus on the HSP90 chaperone system and its co-chaperones. These processes are crucial for proper cellular function and response to environmental stress. The proteins work together to ensure that signaling pathways are correctly regulated and that proteins achieve their proper conformation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis."	0.85	positive regulation of activin receptor signaling pathway	GO:0032927	0.0015994096167624	2	7	11	ACVR2A,ACVR2B	signal transduction  and  protein folding	activin receptor signaling pathway	0.43158934	0.125	0.18181818181818182	ACVR2A ACVR2B AHSA1 ARAF CDC37L1 CHORDC1 HGH1 HSPA4 LRRK2 RAF1 TOMM34	11.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly involves two main biological processes: signal transduction and protein folding.

PEX5L is a variant of PEX5 and is involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. PEX6, PEX16, and PEX26 are involved in the assembly of the peroxisomal membrane and the import of matrix proteins.

7. PSMB1 (Proteasome subunit beta type-1) is a component of the proteasome, which is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. While not a peroxisomal protein, its presence in the system may be related to the degradation of misfolded or unnecessary peroxisomal proteins.

8. SLC25A17 (Solute carrier family 25 member 17) is a peroxisomal membrane protein that functions as a transporter, potentially involved in the import of cofactors or export of metabolites.

In summary, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in peroxisomal functions, including fatty acid metabolism, detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, and catabolism of D-amino acids. The presence of multiple peroxins indicates a strong emphasis on peroxisomal biogenesis and maintenance. The inclusion of PSMB1 suggests a link to protein quality control mechanisms, possibly related to peroxisomal dynamics.

NeST	Cluster2-185	Cluster2-185	AKAP13 KSR1 PRKACG	AKAP13 KSR1 PRKACG	3	cAMP-Dependent Signaling Modulation	"1. AKAP13, also known as A-kinase anchor protein 13, is a scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of multiprotein complexes. It is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including those mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). AKAP13 anchors PKA to specific subcellular locations, facilitating localized signal transduction and ensuring that the kinase is in proximity to its substrates.

2. KSR1, or Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1, functions as a scaffold protein that facilitates the assembly of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase module, a key signaling pathway involved in cell growth and differentiation. While not directly involved in cAMP signaling, KSR1 interacts with components of the MAPK pathway, which can be modulated by cAMP levels through cross-talk between signaling pathways.

3. PRKACG represents the gamma catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. PKA is a tetrameric holoenzyme composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits and is activated upon binding to cAMP. Once activated, PKA phosphorylates a variety of substrates, leading to changes in cell function. The gamma subunit of PKA is one of the catalytic subunits that, upon cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits, is released to phosphorylate target proteins.

The proteins in this system are involved in the modulation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways.

4. CCL1 is a chemokine that attracts immune cells such as T cells to sites of inflammation, while LTB is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family involved in the recruitment of leukocytes during immune responses.

5. IL4 is a key cytokine in the regulation of immune responses, promoting the differentiation of naive helper T cells to Th2 cells and is involved in B cell proliferation.

6. TNFRSF13B (TACI) and TNFRSF13C (BAFF-R) are receptors for TNF family members that are important for B cell development and survival.

7. POU2AF1 (OBF-1) is a coactivator of OCT2 required for the expression of a subset of immunoglobulin genes during B cell development.

8. SPIB is an ETS transcription factor that controls gene expression in B cells and is essential for the differentiation of pro-B to pre-B cells.

9. MZB1 and JCHAIN are involved in the assembly and secretion of immunoglobulins, particularly IgM and IgA.

10. ITM2A and ITM2B are implicated in immune system processes, although their precise roles are not fully understood.

11. RGS13 is a regulator of G protein signaling that modulates signaling downstream of G protein-coupled receptors, including those involved in immune responses.

12. TNFAIP8 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and immune responses, potentially acting as an anti-inflammatory molecule.

13. SLC38A2 is a system A amino acid transporter that can influence immune cell function by regulating the uptake of amino acids necessary for protein synthesis and cell growth.

14. UCP2 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and can modulate immune cell activation and inflammation.

15. VNN1, VNN2, and VNN3 are involved in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation through their pantetheinase activity, which can influence leukocyte trafficking and cell adhesion.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the modulation of immune responses, including the activation and differentiation of B and T cells, NK cell function, chemotaxis, cytokine signaling, and the regulation of inflammation. The system reflects a complex network of interactions that collectively contribute to the immune system's ability to respond to pathogens and maintain homeostasis. The confidence score reflects the strong thematic consistency among the majority of the proteins in the system, although not all proteins have well-characterized roles in immune modulation."	0.85	B cell proliferation	GO:0042100	0.0013219025275515	5	105	45	CCL1,IFITM2,MANSC1,TNFAIP8,TNFRSF13B	immune system modulation  and  inflammation	b cell proliferation	0.25479084	0.034482758620689655	0.1111111111111111	BTN2A1 BTN2A2 CD70 TNFRSF17 CLEC2B KLRC4 CCL1 LTB IL4 TNFRSF13B TNFRSF13C POU2AF1 SPIB MZB1 JCHAIN RGS13 TNFAIP8 UCP2 VNN1 VNN2 VNN3	21.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Immune System Modulation and Inflammation"" due to their roles in various immune processes, including T and B cell activation, NK cell function, cytokine signaling, chemotaxis, and regulation of inflammation.

ARSA (arylsulfatase A), ARSB (arylsulfatase B), GUSB (beta-glucuronidase), NAGLU (alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase), SGSH (N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase), and SUMF2 (sulfatase modifying factor 2) are enzymes involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These enzymes sequentially degrade GAGs, which are complex carbohydrates attached to proteins to form proteoglycans, a major component of the extracellular matrix.

2. GALNS (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase) and CHST10 (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 10) are also involved in the modification and degradation of GAGs. GALNS specifically hydrolyzes the sulfate ester bonds of keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, while CHST10 transfers sulfate groups to position 3 of the glucosamine residue of heparan sulfate.

3. CHPF (chondroitin polymerizing factor) and CHPF2 (chondroitin polymerizing factor 2) are involved in the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate, another type of GAG, by polymerizing the glycosaminoglycan chain.

4. GALNT18 (polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18) is involved in the initial steps of mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation, which can affect the stability and function of proteins, including those involved in GAG metabolism.

5. SIAE (sialic acid acetylesterase) is involved in the regulation of sialylated glycoconjugates, which can include proteoglycans.

6. PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein) is involved in lipid metabolism and may indirectly influence the lipid environment of GAGs and proteoglycans.

7. The proteins PLXNA1 (plexin A1), PLXNA3 (plexin A3), SEMA4F (semaphorin 4F), and MEGF8 (multiple EGF-like-domains 8) are involved in cell signaling and may interact with proteoglycans or GAGs as part of their signaling pathways.

8. MOXD1 (monooxygenase DBH-like 1) and PAM (peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase) are involved in peptide modification and neurotransmitter synthesis, which may be indirectly related to GAG metabolism or signaling.

9. IL17RA (interleukin 17 receptor A) is a cytokine receptor that mediates inflammatory responses and may interact with GAGs in the immune system.

10. CERCAM (cell adhesion molecule) and CHID1 (chitinase domain containing 1) are involved in cell adhesion and immune responses, potentially interacting with the extracellular matrix and GAGs.

ATXN3, KAT2B, KAT6A, KMT2A, and TP53 are involved in the regulation of transcription and chromatin structure. ATXN3 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can regulate transcription by editing ubiquitin chains on histones and transcription factors. KAT2B and KAT6A are histone acetyltransferases that modify chromatin structure to facilitate transcription. KMT2A is a histone methyltransferase that also plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. TP53, or p53, is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of a wide array of genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA repair.

2. CCNA2 and CHEK2 are involved in cell cycle regulation. CCNA2 (Cyclin A2) is essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S and the G2/M transitions. CHEK2 is a kinase that phosphorylates and regulates the activity of various proteins involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoints.

3. COPS5, HDAC2, HDAC3, SKP2, and SYMPK are associated with protein stability and modification. COPS5 is a component of the COP9 signalosome complex that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control and DNA damage response, through the regulation of protein degradation. HDAC2 and HDAC3 are histone deacetylases that remove acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to a more condensed chromatin state and reduced transcriptional activity. SKP2 is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. SYMPK is involved in RNA processing and may play a role in transcriptional regulation.

4. CREBBP, EP300, NCOA1, TCF3, TCF4, and TWIST1 are transcription factors or coactivators that directly interact with DNA to regulate gene expression. CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that act as transcriptional coactivators by remodeling chromatin and acetylating both histone and non-histone proteins. NCOA1 is a nuclear receptor coactivator that interacts with steroid receptors and other transcription factors to enhance transcriptional activation. TCF3 and TCF4 are members of the E-protein family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors that play critical roles in lymphocyte development, and TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in the regulation of developmental processes.

5. CTNNB1 and PYGO2 are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which has roles in cell fate determination, cell migration, cell polarity, neural patterning, and organogenesis. CTNNB1, or β-catenin, is a key downstream effector in the Wnt signaling pathway that can also act as a transcriptional coactivator. PYGO2 is a component of the Wnt signaling pathway that promotes the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and is involved in chromatin remodeling.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. They interact in a complex network that influences cell cycle progression, development, and response to cellular stress. The system's components have roles in modifying chromatin structure, regulating transcription factor activity, and controlling protein stability, all of which are critical for proper gene expression and cellular function."	0.92	positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription	GO:0045893	1.1614947213397208e-12	17	1703	21	CCNA2,CHEK2,COPS5,CREBBP,CTNNB1,EP300,HDAC2,HDAC3,HOXB7,KAT2B,KAT6A,KMT2A,NCOA1,TCF3,TCF4,TP53,TWIST1	chromatin remodeling  and  transcriptional regulation	dna-templated transcription	0.47816825	0.00995899238429994	0.8095238095238095	ATXN3 KAT2B KAT6A KMT2A TP53 HDAC2 HDAC3 CREBBP EP300 NCOA1 TCF3 TCF4 TWIST1 CTNNB1 PYGO2	15.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly involves genes that regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling.

The proteins AR (androgen receptor), THRB (thyroid hormone receptor beta), and RELA (a subunit of NF-kB) are transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate the transcription of target genes. These factors are activated by their respective ligands and play critical roles in processes such as metabolism, cell proliferation, and immune responses.

2. Coactivators such as NCOA1, NCOA2, NCOA3 (nuclear receptor coactivators), CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1), CREBBP (CREB-binding protein), and EP300 (E1A binding protein p300) interact with transcription factors to enhance their transcriptional activity. They function by modifying chromatin structure through acetylation and methylation, thereby facilitating the assembly of the transcriptional machinery.

3. HDAC2 and HDAC3 (histone deacetylases) are involved in chromatin remodeling through the removal of acetyl groups from histones, leading to a more condensed chromatin state and transcriptional repression. They counterbalance the activity of histone acetyltransferases like CREBBP and EP300.

4. HIST1H3A represents the histone proteins that are subject to post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, which affect chromatin structure and gene expression.

5. SMARCE1 is part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex that alters chromatin structure to regulate gene expression by facilitating nucleosome sliding.

6. TP53BP1 and MDM2 are involved in the DNA damage response. TP53BP1 is a mediator of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks, while MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates the p53 tumor suppressor.

7. SMAD2 is a signal transducer for TGF-beta receptors, which regulates gene expression in response to TGF-beta signaling.

8. COPS2 is part of the COP9 signalosome, a complex that regulates protein stability and degradation, and may indirectly influence transcriptional regulation.

9. LCOR is a ligand-dependent nuclear receptor corepressor that modulates the activity of various transcription factors.

10. PSME3 and TSG101 are involved in protein degradation pathways, with PSME3 being part of the proteasome and TSG101 part of the ESCRT complex, both of which can regulate the turnover of transcription factors and co-regulators.

COPS5, also known as CSN5 or JAB1, is a component of the COP9 signalosome complex that regulates protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling by modulating the activity of key signaling intermediates through deneddylation, thus affecting the transcription of NF-κB target genes.

2. MAP3K14, also known as NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase), is a central kinase in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. It phosphorylates and activates IKKα, leading to the processing of p100 to p52 and subsequent translocation of p52/RelB heterodimers to the nucleus, which is crucial for the transcription of specific NF-κB-dependent genes.

3. MTOR, the mechanistic target of rapamycin, is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism, responding to nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy status. It is also implicated in the regulation of NF-κB signaling and autophagy, a process of cellular degradation and recycling of cellular components.

4. RNF31, also known as HOIP, is a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) that is involved in NF-κB signaling. It mediates the formation of linear ubiquitin chains on key signaling proteins, which is essential for the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway and the regulation of inflammation and immunity.

5. SQSTM1, or p62, is a multifunctional protein that serves as a scaffold in various signaling pathways, including NF-κB signaling. It also plays a critical role in autophagy by serving as a link between LC3 and ubiquitinated substrates, thus facilitating the degradation of these substrates in autophagosomes.

6. TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1, is involved in the regulation of innate immune responses. It phosphorylates and activates key substrates in the type I interferon signaling pathway and is also implicated in the regulation of autophagy through phosphorylation of autophagy-related proteins.

7. TNF, tumor necrosis factor, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in inflammation and immunity. It activates the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway through its receptor TNFR1, leading to the transcription of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation.

8. TRAF1, TNF receptor-associated factor 1, is an adaptor protein that participates in TNF receptor signaling complexes. It modulates the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and is involved in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis.

In summary, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways, both canonical and non-canonical, and autophagy.

BID is a BH3-interacting domain death agonist. Upon activation by caspase-8, it translocates to mitochondria and promotes the release of cytochrome c (CYCS), leading to the activation of downstream caspases. It serves as a molecular link between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis.

2. CASP1, or caspase-1, is an enzyme that plays a role in the inflammatory response and pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis. It is involved in the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although not directly apoptotic, it can influence apoptotic processes through cross-talk with other signaling pathways.

3. CYCS, cytochrome c, released from the mitochondria upon apoptotic stimuli, is a critical component of the apoptosome, a complex that activates caspase-9, leading to the activation of the caspase cascade and cell death.

4. DAXX is a multifunctional protein involved in apoptosis, transcription, and chromatin remodeling. It can enhance apoptosis by interacting with apoptosis-regulating proteins such as ASK1 and JNK.

5. MAP2K4, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, is involved in the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway. It phosphorylates and activates MAPK8, which is implicated in the transduction of apoptotic signals.

6. MAPK1, also known as ERK2, is part of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. It can play a role in the induction of apoptosis depending on the cellular context and the strength and duration of its activation.

7. MAPK8, or JNK1, is activated by various cell stresses and inflammatory cytokines. It promotes apoptosis by phosphorylating and modulating the activity of several transcription factors, and proteins like BIM and BID.

8. PSME3, also known as PA28-gamma, is a proteasome activator that has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle. It can influence the degradation of various proteins involved in apoptotic pathways.

9. SIRT1 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that modulates processes such as apoptosis and stress resistance. It can deacetylate and affect the activity of several proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway, including p53.

10. XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, is a potent inhibitor of the caspase cascade. It binds to and inhibits caspases -3, -7, and -9, thereby suppressing apoptosis.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation and execution of apoptosis. They interact in a network that integrates extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signals, stress responses, and inflammation. The system includes initiators, effectors, and regulators of apoptosis, which can have synergistic or antagonistic effects on cell death pathways. The prominence of apoptotic proteins in this system, along with their interconnected roles, supports the high confidence score for the process name."	0.92	apoptotic process	GO:0006915	2.2636901625182205e-08	10	1913	10	BID,CASP1,CYCS,DAXX,MAP2K4,MAPK1,MAPK8,PSME3,SIRT1,XIAP	apoptotic signaling pathway	apoptotic process	0.84523964	0.005227391531625719	1.0	BID CYCS DAXX MAP2K4 MAPK8 XIAP	6.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set predominantly supports the name ""Apoptotic Signaling Pathway"" as most genes are directly involved in the regulation, execution, or modulation of apoptosis.

Several proteins in this system, such as STAT1, MYD88, OAS3, DHX58, and MX1, are key components of the immune response, particularly in the context of viral defense mechanisms. STAT1 is a critical transcription factor in the interferon signaling pathway, which is activated in response to viral infections. MYD88 is an adaptor protein that plays a central role in the innate immune response to pathogens. OAS3, DHX58 (also known as LGP2), and MX1 are involved in recognizing viral RNA and mediating antiviral responses.

2. Proteins like CFLAR, CASP4, BCL2L13, and MCL1 are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. CFLAR (also known as c-FLIP) is an inhibitor of death receptor signaling, which can prevent apoptosis. CASP4 is a caspase that can initiate inflammatory forms of cell death. BCL2L13 and MCL1 are members of the Bcl-2 family, which are key regulators of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

3. The presence of HLA-G, a non-classical MHC class I molecule, suggests a role in immune tolerance, particularly during pregnancy, where it contributes to the protection of the fetus from the maternal immune system.

4. Proteins such as NFKB2 and TRIM21 are involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, which is a central pathway in the immune response, inflammation, and cell survival.

5. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is represented by proteins like USP14, USP18, and UBA6, which are involved in protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes, including the immune response.

6. Proteins like NLRC5 and BATF2 are also associated with immune functions. NLRC5 is involved in the regulation of MHC class I genes, and BATF2 is a transcription factor that can be induced by interferons.

7. The system includes several proteins with roles in RNA processing and regulation, such as PNPT1, which is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing, and RBMS2, which is involved in mRNA stabilization.

8. Proteins like GALNT7 and MOCOS are involved in post-translational modifications and enzyme cofactor biosynthesis, respectively, which can indirectly affect various biological processes, including immune responses.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and homeostasis in the face of pathogenic challenge. The system also includes proteins that contribute to immune tolerance and the regulation of inflammation.

SIGLEC7 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (siglecs) family, which are typically involved in cell-cell interactions and signaling through recognition of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates. It is primarily found on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and plays a role in the inhibition of NK cell activation, thus contributing to immune regulation.

2. C11ORF85, also known as hydrocephalus-inducing protein homolog (HYDIN2), is a poorly characterized protein with limited available functional data. It is believed to be a paralog of the HYDIN gene, which is involved in ciliary function and is associated with hydrocephalus due to its role in the motility of cilia in the brain.

3. PPL, or periplakin, is a component of the cornified envelope of keratinocytes and is involved in linking the cytoskeleton to the intercellular junctions in epithelial cells. It plays a role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells and is implicated in the maintenance of skin barrier function.

4. NTN1, or netrin 1, is a secreted protein involved in axon guidance during neural development. It interacts with receptors on the surface of neurons to guide axon growth and cell migration. Netrin 1 also has roles outside the nervous system, including in angiogenesis and the regulation of epithelial cell behavior.

5. ZNF181 is a member of the zinc finger protein family, which typically acts as transcription factors binding to DNA and regulating gene expression. The specific functions of ZNF181 are not well characterized, but zinc finger proteins are generally involved in developmental processes and cellular differentiation.

Several proteins in this system, such as CDC45, CCNF, AURKA, ASF1B, FANCI, CCNB1, KIF2C, CEP170, and ERCC6L, are directly involved in cell cycle regulation and progression. CDC45 is a key player in the initiation of DNA replication, while cyclin F (CCNF) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are essential for the regulation of different phases of the cell cycle. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is critical for mitotic spindle assembly, and KIF2C is involved in chromosome segregation.

2. Proteins like EXO1, DEPDC1B, and FANCI are associated with DNA repair mechanisms. EXO1 is a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair and recombination, while FANCI is part of the Fanconi anemia pathway, crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. DEPDC1B has been implicated in the regulation of cell division and may have a role in the DNA damage response.

3. The presence of proteins such as ERCC6L, a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair, and ASF1B, which is important for chromatin assembly and disassembly during DNA replication and repair, further supports the involvement of this system in DNA damage response and repair.

4. The system also includes proteins like TAF12, which is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, playing a role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and thus indirectly influencing cell cycle progression.

5. Additionally, proteins such as MYO5A, involved in organelle and vesicle transport, and AQP9, a water channel protein, suggest roles in cellular homeostasis and metabolism that can be critical for cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally interconnected through their roles in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage response. The system appears to be primarily oriented towards ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic integrity, with additional roles in transcription regulation and cellular transport mechanisms that support these primary functions."	0.92	microtubule organizing center organization	GO:0031023	0.0842060289668532	6	154	85	CCNF,AURKA,TUBE1,CENPJ,CCDC42,MPDZ	cell cycle progression  and  dna damage response	microtubule organizing center organization	0.36583728	0.02575107296137339	0.07058823529411765	CDC45 CCNF AURKA ASF1B FANCI CCNB1 KIF2C ERCC6L EXO1	9.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cell Cycle Progression and DNA Damage Response"" due to their direct involvement in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair mechanisms.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular functions such as ion transport (SLC39A5, SLC5A12), signal transduction (EPHB1, GPR89A, IRS1), gene regulation (HEY2, MEIS2, CHD4), protein synthesis (MRPL47, RPS16P5), cell structure and motility (DPYSL5, SHROOM2), apoptosis (PDCD6), metabolism (FAAH2, RFK), and many others.

1. Several proteins like SLC39A5 and SLC5A12 are transporters, indicating roles in ion and nutrient transport, but they do not suggest a unified process.

2. Signal transduction is represented by proteins such as EPHB1 and IRS1, which are involved in different signaling pathways and do not point to a single, cohesive biological process.

3. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like HEY2 and MEIS2, but they regulate diverse sets of genes and are involved in various developmental and cellular processes.

4. Proteins involved in protein synthesis, such as MRPL47 and RPS16P5, are essential for general cellular function and do not define a specific biological process within this system.

5. Cell structure and motility are influenced by proteins like DPYSL5 and SHROOM2, but again, these proteins are involved in different aspects of cellular architecture and movement.

6. Apoptosis and metabolism are represented by proteins such as PDCD6 and FAAH2, respectively, but these proteins are part of broader cellular functions and do not align to a single process.

The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.

2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.

3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.

4. Proteins such as SLC34A1, SLC15A3, and SLC23A2 are transporters that facilitate the movement of specific substrates across cellular membranes. SLC34A1 is a phosphate transporter, SLC15A3 is a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, and SLC23A2 is a vitamin C transporter.

5. The presence of proteins like IDH3A, LDHB, and GYS1 indicates involvement in metabolic processes. IDH3A is a subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase involved in the TCA cycle, LDHB is involved in lactate metabolism, and GYS1 is glycogen synthase, which plays a role in glycogen biosynthesis.

6. Proteins such as OPTN, CEACAM1, and PLAUR are implicated in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions. OPTN is involved in autophagy and NF-κB signaling, CEACAM1 participates in cell adhesion and signaling, and PLAUR (uPAR) is involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling.

To summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.

WDR16, or WD repeat domain 16, is a protein that is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and may play a role in autophagy. The specific functions of WDR16 are not well-characterized, but given its domain structure, it is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate signal transduction pathways or assembly of protein complexes.

2. GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to internal signaling pathways. The gamma subunit, along with the beta subunit, forms a complex that interacts with the alpha subunit and receptors. GNG12 is implicated in the modulation of various signaling cascades, including those that regulate cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and possibly angiogenesis.

3. NSMAF, also known as neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activation associated factor, is involved in the ceramide signaling pathway. Ceramide is a lipid molecule that acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling cascades, particularly those related to stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis. NSMAF is thought to be involved in the activation of N-SMase, which leads to the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling. WDR16 may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes or pathways, GNG12 is directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and NSMAF is associated with lipid signaling pathways. While the specific interactions between these proteins are not well-defined, their collective involvement in signaling suggests a role in modulating intracellular communication and response to external stimuli. The confidence score reflects the fact that while each protein is involved in signaling, the direct connections and integration of their functions within a single, prominent biological process are not fully established."	0.75	establishment of left/right asymmetry	GO:0061966	0.0539050205810023	1	7	3	CFAP52	intracellular signaling modulation	establishment of left/right asymmetry	0.35764408	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	GNG12 NSMAF	2.0	"-- Summary --||The gene set ""Intracellular Signaling Modulation"" is supported by the functions of WDR16, GNG12, and NSMAF.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, protein processing, cellular metabolism, and immune responses. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Signal Transduction: Proteins like MAP3K7, GPR110, and TNFRSF11A are involved in different signaling pathways. MAP3K7 is a kinase that plays a role in the NF-kappaB pathway, while GPR110 is a G protein-coupled receptor, and TNFRSF11A is a receptor for TNFSF11/RANKL and is important for osteoclastogenesis.

2. Gene Regulation: Transcription factors like FOXP1 and KLF5 are involved in regulating gene expression. FOXP1 is implicated in the development of several tissues, including the heart and lung, while KLF5 plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.

3. Protein Processing and Trafficking: SEC61B is part of the protein translocation apparatus in the endoplasmic reticulum, and KDELR2 is involved in the retrieval of ER-resident proteins. Proteins like CUL4A and UBE4B are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for protein degradation.

4. Metabolism: Enzymes like GDA (guanine deaminase) and GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase) are involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, respectively.

5. Immune Response: HLA-DRB1 is an MHC class II cell surface receptor important for the immune system to recognize foreign molecules.

6. RNA Processing: Proteins like SRRM1 and DDX54 are involved in RNA splicing and remodeling, which are critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

7. Cell Cycle and Division: NEK2 is a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, and STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division.

8. Apoptosis and Cell Survival: MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, while TNFSF10 (TRAIL) is a cytokine that induces apoptosis.

9. Structural Components: TPM1 is a tropomyosin protein that plays a role in the structure and function of the cytoskeleton.

The proteins listed span various functional categories, including transcription regulation (e.g., KLF5, ZNF622), protein degradation (e.g., RFWD2, MKRN2), intracellular transport (e.g., VPS33A, TIMM23), metabolic processes (e.g., UMPS, GNPAT), and signal transduction (e.g., PPP3CC, ATR). 

1. Several zinc finger proteins (e.g., ZNF845, ZNF79, ZNF131, ZNF419) are present, which typically act as transcription factors, each likely regulating distinct sets of genes. Their specific targets and functions can be diverse, ranging from developmental processes to cellular stress responses.

2. Proteins involved in intracellular trafficking and organelle function are represented by TIMM23, a component of the mitochondrial import machinery, and VPS33A, which is part of the HOPS complex involved in vesicular transport.

3. Metabolic enzymes such as UMPS, which is involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis, and GNPAT, which plays a role in ether lipid synthesis, indicate participation in distinct metabolic pathways.

4. Signal transduction is represented by proteins like PPP3CC, a catalytic subunit of calcineurin, and ATR, a key player in DNA damage response.

5. Proteins with roles in protein synthesis and assembly include GTPBP10, which is involved in ribosome biogenesis, and MRPL46, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome.

The proteins listed are involved in various aspects of cellular biology, including but not limited to RNA processing, protein transport, signal transduction, gene regulation, metabolic processes, and structural maintenance of chromosomes. Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying process, it is not possible to assign a specific biological process to this system of proteins with any level of confidence.

For instance, proteins such as HOTTIP (a long non-coding RNA involved in chromatin dynamics and gene expression), NEU1 (a sialidase involved in lysosomal catabolism of sialylated compounds), and ARFGAP3 (a GTPase-activating protein involved in vesicle trafficking) have roles that are distinct and do not suggest a common biological pathway or process.

Similarly, proteins like MAPKAPK2 (an enzyme involved in the MAPK signaling pathway), SLC35B4 (a solute carrier family member involved in transport within the Golgi), and MIS12 (a component of the kinetochore complex involved in chromosome segregation) further illustrate the heterogeneity of the system.

The presence of proteins such as TOR1AIP2 (involved in the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum structure), NME1 (a nucleoside diphosphate kinase involved in nucleotide metabolism), and AIDA (involved in axin-mediated beta-catenin degradation) underscores the lack of a shared process among the proteins listed.

Given the diversity of these proteins and the absence of a predominant theme or pathway, the most appropriate designation for this system is ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the lack of a coherent biological process that can be discerned from the information provided.

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:

1. Several proteins such as TSPEAR, SST (somatostatin), PAX6, and METTL3 are involved in distinct cellular processes. For example, TSPEAR is associated with Notch signaling and development, SST is a hormone that inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones, PAX6 is a key regulatory gene in eye and neural development, and METTL3 is involved in mRNA methylation, impacting RNA stability and translation.

2. Proteins like SETMAR, ZMIZ1, and SMAD7 are implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, respectively. These proteins play roles in maintaining genomic integrity, regulating gene expression, and modulating cell signaling pathways.

3. Proteins such as GNG3 (a G protein subunit), KIF2C (a kinesin involved in mitosis), and STK3 (a serine/threonine kinase) are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and apoptosis, which are fundamental cellular processes but not indicative of a unified biological process within this system.

4. Transport and trafficking proteins like SLC19A2 (a thiamine transporter), MAGOH (involved in mRNA splicing and export), and ABCA6 (a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family) highlight the diversity of functions related to cellular transport mechanisms present in this system.

5. Proteins such as FERMT1 and ACTR6 are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, respectively, which are critical for cellular structure and motility but do not suggest a common biological process for the system.

6. The presence of non-coding RNA genes like MORC2-AS1 and THAP7-AS1 indicates regulatory roles at the RNA level, adding another layer of functional diversity to the system.

7. The inclusion of proteins with poorly characterized functions or those represented by locus names (e.g., LOC100131929, C1ORF213) further complicates the identification of a unified biological process.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in a multitude of cellular functions, including development, hormone signaling, gene expression regulation, RNA processing, transport, cell signaling, and structural integrity.

Several proteins in this system, such as IRF1, IRF7, IRF9, ISG15, and IFI35, are key components of the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. These proteins are involved in the transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which play a crucial role in the innate immune response against viral infections.

2. Proteins like OAS1 and RNASEL are part of the antiviral response, where they detect viral RNA and activate pathways that degrade viral nucleic acids, inhibiting viral replication.

3. TRIM21, TRIM22, and TRIM38 are members of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein family, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases that facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, including those from invading pathogens.

4. TAP1, PSME2, and HLA-F are involved in antigen processing and presentation. TAP1 is part of the transporter associated with antigen processing, which transports peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. PSME2 is a component of the immunoproteasome that processes antigens for presentation, and HLA-F is a non-classical MHC class I molecule that may be involved in immune regulation.

5. TNFAIP3 (A20) and GADD45A are involved in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. TNFAIP3 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that negatively regulates NF-kB signaling, while GADD45A is involved in stress-induced apoptosis and DNA repair.

6. Proteins such as EIF2AK1 and EIF2A are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, particularly under stress conditions such as viral infection. EIF2AK1 phosphorylates EIF2, leading to a reduction in global protein synthesis, which is a host defense mechanism to prevent viral protein translation.

7. CMPK2, DNAJB11, PDIA4, and DNAJB9 are involved in various aspects of cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis during viral infections.

8. Proteins like CXCL10 are chemokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection, while LIFR is involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the innate immune response, particularly in the context of antiviral defense. They contribute to the detection of viral components, the activation of interferon signaling pathways, the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis, and the processing and presentation of viral antigens. The system reflects a coordinated response to maintain cellular integrity and to initiate adaptive immunity."	0.92	response to external

2. SAMD9L, the sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein, has been implicated in the innate immune response and may also play a role in cellular stress responses, potentially by regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis.

3. CEBPB and CEBPG are members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family and function as transcription factors that regulate genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, as well as in cellular metabolism, particularly under stress conditions.

4. PSMD12, a component of the 19S proteasome, is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process that is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, especially during cellular stress when damaged proteins accumulate.

5. RSRC2 and HNRNPA1 are RNA-binding proteins that influence RNA splicing and stability, which are critical for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during stress responses.

6. XBP1 is a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to restore normal function by enhancing the production of molecular chaperones and components of the protein degradation machinery.

7. GADD45A is involved in the response to environmental stress and DNA damage, and it plays a role in growth arrest and apoptosis, which are important for cellular recovery and adaptation to stress.

8. USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can regulate the stability of proteins involved in the DNA damage response and may also influence other stress response pathways.

9. HIAT1, MSANTD3, NDFIP1, WRB, KLHL36, EIF2A, CALML4, GCLM, KDM5B, GNA12, ZNF655, and METTL21B are proteins with various functions, including neurotransmitter transport (HIAT1), regulation of gene expression (MSANTD3, KDM5B, ZNF655), protein translation initiation (EIF2A), calcium signaling (CALML4), redox homeostasis (GCLM), and protein methylation (METTL21B). These proteins may contribute to the overall cellular response to stress by modulating specific pathways or cellular processes.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a coordinated response to cellular stress, which includes the regulation of gene expression, mRNA processing, protein synthesis, and degradation, as well as DNA repair and cell cycle control. The system reflects a multifaceted approach to maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity under stress conditions, with a significant proportion of the proteins directly participating in stress response pathways."	0.85	hepatocyte proliferation	GO:0072574	0.0163492276917296	2	24	18	CEBPB,XBP1	cellular stress response  and  protein homeostasis	hepatocyte proliferation	0.3595819	0.05	0.1111111111111111	RNMT CEBPB CEBPG PSMD12 XBP1 GADD45A	6.0	"-- Summary --||The selected genes support the name ""Cellular Stress Response and Protein Homeostasis"" as they are involved in various processes critical for managing cellular stress, including mRNA processing, protein synthesis and degradation, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, intracellular transport, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:

1. Signal transduction and cellular communication are represented by proteins like FGF19 (a member of the fibroblast growth factor family with roles in bile acid synthesis regulation and metabolic homeostasis), EFNB2 (a member of the ephrin family involved in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system), and GPRC5A (a G protein-coupled receptor with potential roles in cancer development).

2. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like GABPA (a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular growth control), RBM39 (an RNA-binding protein implicated in splicing), and TRIM66 (a tripartite motif-containing protein that may function as a transcriptional regulator).

3. Intracellular transport and cellular organization are represented by proteins such as KIF18A (a kinesin involved in mitotic spindle assembly), STARD4 (involved in cholesterol trafficking), and CAPZA3 (a capping protein regulating actin filament dynamics).

4. Metabolic processes are covered by proteins like SLC19A1 (a transporter involved in folate uptake), SCP2 (a sterol carrier protein involved in lipid transfer), and MCCC2 (an enzyme in the leucine degradation pathway).

5. Cell cycle and DNA damage response are represented by RAD9B (involved in cell cycle checkpoint control) and UCHL1 (a deubiquitinating enzyme with roles in protein degradation).

6. Other diverse functions include HYI (hydroxypyruvate isomerase involved in serine metabolism), ANG (angiogenin with roles in angiogenesis), and CPA3 (carboxypeptidase A3 involved in the maturation of mast cell proteases).

Given the broad spectrum of functions and the lack of a unifying biological process, it is appropriate to name this system as a ""System of unrelated proteins."" The confidence score is 0.00, indicating that there is no single prominent biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins."	0.0	bile acid biosynthetic process	GO:0006699	0.0775309996335331	3	38	44	FGF19,STARD4,SCP2	system of unrelated proteins	bile acid biosynthetic process		0.0379746835443038	0.06818181818181818											False	False

7. DNA and RNA processing (e.g., DDX19A, a DEAD-box RNA helicase involved in mRNA export from the nucleus).

Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying theme or pathway that they are all significantly involved in, it is not possible to assign a specific biological process that is prominently performed by this system.

The diversity of these proteins' functions, ranging from structural roles to enzymatic activities and from signal transduction to gene regulation, indicates that they are not collectively dedicated to a singular, well-defined biological process. For example, AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal development, while GCKR (glucokinase regulator) is involved in glucose metabolism. The presence of proteins such as AR (androgen receptor) and CYP19A1 (aromatase, which is involved in steroid metabolism) further illustrates the heterogeneity of the system.

Additionally, proteins like BIRC5 (survivin, involved in inhibiting apoptosis and cell cycle regulation), KIF18A (kinesin involved in mitotic spindle assembly), and BBS10 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein, involved in ciliary function) suggest roles in cell division, intracellular transport, and structural maintenance of cilia, respectively.
