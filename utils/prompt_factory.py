To help you in your work, I am providing an example system of interacting proteins and the corresponding example analysis output.

The example system of interacting proteins is:
PDX1, SLC2A2, NKX6-1, GLP1, GCG.

The example analysis output is:

Process: Pancreatic development and glucose homeostasis (0.96)

1. PDX1 is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the specification of the early pancreatic epithelium and its subsequent differentiation. 
It activates the transcription of several genes including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase and glucose transporter type 2. 
It is essential for maintenance of the normal hormone-producing phenotype in the pancreatic beta-cell. 
In pancreatic acinar cells, forms a complex with PBX1b and MEIS2b and mediates the activation of the ELA1 enhancer.

2. NKX6-1 is also a transcription factor involved in the development of pancreatic beta-cells during the secondary transition. 
Together with NKX2-2 and IRX3, controls the generation of motor neurons in the neural tube and belongs to the neural progenitor 
factors induced by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signals.

3.GCG and GLP1, respectively glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1, are involved in glucose metabolism and homeostasis. 
GCG raises blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and is the counter regulatory hormone of Insulin. 
GLP1 is a potent stimulator of Glucose-Induced Insulin Secretion (GSIS). Plays roles in gastric motility and suppresses blood glucagon levels. 
Promotes growth of the intestinal epithelium and pancreatic islet mass both by islet neogenesis and islet cell proliferation.

4. SLC2A2, also known as GLUT2, is a facilitative hexose transporter. In hepatocytes, it mediates bi-directional transport of glucose accross the plasma membranes, 
while in the pancreatic beta-cell, it is the main transporter responsible for glucose uptake and part of the cell's glucose-sensing mechanism. 
It is involved in glucose transport in the small intestine and kidney too.

To summarize, the genes in this set are involved in the specification, differentiation, growth and functionality of the pancreas, 
with a particular emphasis on the pancreatic beta-cell. Particularly, the architecture of the pancreatic islet ensures proper glucose sensing 
and homeostasis via a number of different hormones and receptors that can elicit both synergistic and antagonistic effects in the pancreas itself and other peripheral tissues.
