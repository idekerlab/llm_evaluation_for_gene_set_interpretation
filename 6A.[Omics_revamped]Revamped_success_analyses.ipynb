Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Metabolic enzymes such as ABAT, ASS1, and DLD are involved in amino acid metabolism and the citric acid cycle, respectively. These enzymes are crucial for energy production and nitrogen balance.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like CHI3L1 and GAL are associated with inflammation and neurotransmission, indicating roles in immune response and nervous system function.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Transport and structural proteins such as CLDN3, CAV1, and CAV2 are involved in maintaining cellular barriers and modulating signal transduction pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Transcription and translation regulatory proteins like ATF1, EIF4A1, and POLR2K are key components in gene expression and protein synthesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Signal transduction molecules such as PIK3R1 and PTGER4 play roles in various signaling pathways, including those related to cell growth and immune response.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Extracellular matrix and cell adhesion proteins like THBS1 and TNS1 are involved in cell-matrix interactions, which are critical for tissue integrity and repair.\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and systemic functions, including but not limited to, metabolism, signal transduction, structural integrity, gene regulation, and immune responses. A critical analysis of the proteins reveals the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as CYB5A, HSD17B2, and SRD5A1 are involved in metabolic processes, but they act on different substrates and pathways, indicating a lack of a unified metabolic function.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like FCER1A, C3, and CD52 play roles in the immune system, yet they represent different aspects of immune responses and are not indicative of a singular immune-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Transcription factors and gene regulators such as NFATC3, ETS2, and RAD21 are present, but they target a variety of genes and are involved in diverse cellular processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Structural proteins like TUBB2A and cytoskeletal regulators such as CCT2 and CNN3 are included, but they do not suggest a specific structural or motility-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Proteins involved in cell signaling and communication, such as WNT5A, LPAR1, and MET, are part of the system, yet they participate in different signaling pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. There are also proteins with roles in extracellular matrix organization and tissue remodeling, such as SPARC, TIMP2, and EFEMP1, but again, these do not align to a single process.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Transporters and channels like SLC30A1 and SLC16A7 are involved in ion and metabolite transport, but they do not represent a unified transport-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, dominant biological process that these proteins collectively perform, it is appropriate to name this system as a \"System of unrelated proteins\" with a confidence score of 0.00.

       "2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that control the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. LDLR is responsible for the removal of cholesterol from the bloodstream via endocytosis of lipoprotein particles.\n",

       "To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of cholesterol and lipids. They participate in the mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and desaturation, and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. The system reflects a coordinated network that ensures the synthesis, uptake, and regulation of lipids and cholesterol, which are vital for membrane structure, energy storage, and signaling molecules.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.\n",
       "\n",
       "To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses.

       "To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in a range of processes, but a significant number of them play roles in the cellular response to stress and the regulation of apoptosis. These proteins interact in complex ways to maintain cellular integrity and respond to damage, with implications for cell survival, cell cycle control, and programmed cell death. The confidence score reflects the fact that while many proteins in the system contribute to these processes, not all are directly involved, and the system represents a network with diverse functions.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and molecular functions such as signal transduction, immune response, transcription regulation, cell adhesion, metabolism, and others. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins like HOXB6 (a homeobox protein), NFIB (a transcription factor), and MAFF (a basic leucine zipper transcription factor) are involved in gene expression regulation but do not share a common pathway or target genes.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins such as AGR2 (anterior gradient 2) and TFF1/TFF3 (trefoil factors) are associated with mucosal protection and repair, but their roles are not directly linked to a single, unified process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family and plays a role in developmental processes and cancer, but it does not appear to be functionally integrated with the majority of the other proteins listed.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. The presence of immune-related proteins such as HLA-DOB (an MHC class II protein) and CXCL12 (a chemokine) suggests involvement in immune response, yet this does not represent a primary process for the entire group.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Metabolic enzymes and transporters like ACSL3 (acyl-CoA synthetase) and SLC7A8 (a solute carrier protein) are involved in distinct metabolic pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Structural proteins such as COL9A2 (collagen type IX) and LAMB1 (laminin subunit beta-1) are key for maintaining the integrity of extracellular matrix and basement membranes but are not functionally related to the other proteins in a single process.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Cell signaling and stress response proteins like PLCB3 (phospholipase C beta 3), SGK1 (serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1), and ANXA1 (annexin A1) are involved in various signaling pathways without a common signaling process.\n",
       "\n",

Here is a breakdown of the functional diversity within the system:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as AKAP12, STK39, and PSD3 are involved in cellular signaling pathways, but they do not converge on a single, predominant signaling process.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like ANXA3, CAV1, and CD44 are associated with cellular structure and adhesion, yet they do not collectively represent a specific structural or adhesion-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. CDKN1C and RPS4Y1 are involved in cell cycle regulation and ribosomal function, respectively, but these functions do not dominate the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolic enzymes such as CYP1B1, DLD, and GMDS participate in various metabolic pathways without a shared primary metabolic process.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Transcriptional regulation is represented by proteins like PBX1 and SOX11, but they are not part of a cohesive transcriptional network within this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Proteins such as HBB and NTS are related to oxygen transport and neurotransmission, which are distinct physiological processes.\n",

       "Given the heterogeneity of the functions and the lack of a central biological process that involves a majority of the proteins, it is appropriate to name this system \"System of unrelated proteins\" and assign a confidence score of 0.00.

Several proteins in this system, such as CD44, VCAN (Versican), and CHI3L1 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1), are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. VCAN is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in tissue remodeling and is often upregulated in various cancers.\n",

Proteins like EXT1 (Exostosin-1) and XYLT1 (Xylosyltransferase 1) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, respectively. These activities are crucial for the structure and function of the ECM, which is a key component of the tumor microenvironment.\n",

The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.\n",

       "2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.\n",

       "3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.\n",

       "To summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.\n",

WDR16, or WD repeat domain 16, is a protein that is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and may play a role in autophagy. The specific functions of WDR16 are not well-characterized, but given its domain structure, it is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate signal transduction pathways or assembly of protein complexes.\n",

       "2. GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to internal signaling pathways. The gamma subunit, along with the beta subunit, forms a complex that interacts with the alpha subunit and receptors. GNG12 is implicated in the modulation of various signaling cascades, including those that regulate cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and possibly angiogenesis.\n",

       "3. NSMAF, also known as neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activation associated factor, is involved in the ceramide signaling pathway. Ceramide is a lipid molecule that acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling cascades, particularly those related to stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis. NSMAF is thought to be involved in the activation of N-SMase, which leads to the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin.\n",

       "To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling. WDR16 may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes or pathways, GNG12 is directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and NSMAF is associated with lipid signaling pathways. While the specific interactions between these proteins are not well-defined, their collective involvement in signaling suggests a role in modulating intracellular communication and response to external stimuli. The confidence score reflects the fact that while each protein is involved in signaling, the direct connections and integration of their functions within a single, prominent biological process are not fully established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>0.75</td><td>⋯</td><td>NSMAF                                      </td><td>Ceramide Metabolic Process (GO:0006672)                                                         </td><td>Ceramide Metabolic Process                                                          </td><td>GO:0006672</td><td>TLCD3B AGK PPP2R1A DEGS2 DEGS1 NSMAF ASAH2 SAMD8 ST6GALNAC3 SGMS2 CERK SGMS1 ALOX12B CYP4F22 FUT3 ASAH1 FUT5 FUT7 FUT6 SGPL1 ORMDL3 SPTSSA SPTSSB ALOXE3 ABCA2 CERS4 CERS5 CERS6 GDF1 CEL ORMDL1 ORMDL2 PPP2CA ACER3 FA2H ACER2 TM9SF2 ACER1 PLA2G15 PLPP3 PNPLA1 CERS2 PLPP2 ST6GALNAC6 CERS3 PLPP1 GBA1 CLN8 CLN6 SMPD4 SPTLC1 SPTLC2 SPTLC3 SMPD2 SMPD1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>0.3533867</td><td>0.01754386</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td></tr>\n",

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The proteins span multiple cellular compartments and systems, including transcription factors (FOXM1, HNF4G, SP2), enzymes (LDHA, ACHE, FN3K), structural proteins (KRT39), and receptors (CXCR4, OR7A5).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Some proteins are involved in signal transduction and immune responses (CXCR4, IL6, CCL2), while others are implicated in metabolic processes (LDHA, ACHE, GYG1).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Several proteins have roles in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (CDC7, WEE1, FOXM1), whereas others are involved in neuronal development and function (NELL2, PDYN, PCP4L1).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. A few proteins are associated with specific diseases or conditions, such as NPC2 with Niemann-Pick disease and G6PC3 with severe congenital neutropenia.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. There are proteins that are less characterized or have unknown functions (LOC100128002, KIAA1377), which further complicates the identification of a common biological process.\n",

       "6. The list includes proteins that are part of the ribosomal machinery (RPL22, RPL38) and protein synthesis (EIF3E, NAA10), but these do not represent a majority of the system.\n",

       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear majority of proteins participating in a single, coherent biological process, it is appropriate to conclude that this system does not revolve around a central biological theme.

The confidence score assigned to this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a prominent biological process within this system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>0.00</td><td>⋯</td><td>HSP90AA1;STUB1;PARK7;TPPP                  </td><td>Positive Regulation Of Protein-Containing Complex Assembly (GO:0031334)                         </td><td>Positive Regulation Of Protein-Containing Complex Assembly                          </td><td>GO:0031334</td><td>TGFB1 BIK SH3GLB1 UNC13B MED9 PSMC6 CXCL13 DEPDC1B TRABD2A BAX AJUBA SKAP1 TP53 TRABD2B CSF2 CLU PARK7 TNF RASIP1 BCL2L11 CDH5 DHX33 RPS3 GBP2 GBP5 SNCA NEK7 TIRAP ISG15 TERF1 FERMT1 FERMT2 MYD88 MAVS EIF4G1 PRKD1 BTK CDC42EP2 FSCN1 TTBK1 VCP TFRC PIEZO1 ICE1 LGALS3 CHAF1B TCL1A USP50 BMF PLCG2 MARK4 HSP90AA1 MMP1 MMP3 NRG1 SPIDR VEGFA RHOC GNL3L IL5 TPPP2 TPPP3 LCP1 TAL1 IFNG ATM TLR6 ATR TLR4 HRK DDX3X GSK3B PTPN22 BRK1 MTLN RAP1B CLEC7A STMP1 CD36 FNIP2 TPPP FNIP1 SLF2 SLF1 SYK WARS1 DAB2IP PPP2CA STUB1 SRC PLEK FAF1 CAPG MAPK8 SUMO1 BAK1 RACK1 BID                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>0.3543378</td><td>0.02116402</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td></tr>\n",

       "\n",
       "1. Signal Transduction: Proteins like MAP3K7, GPR110, and TNFRSF11A are involved in different signaling pathways. MAP3K7 is a kinase that plays a role in the NF-kappaB pathway, while GPR110 is a G protein-coupled receptor, and TNFRSF11A is a receptor for TNFSF11/RANKL and is important for osteoclastogenesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Gene Regulation: Transcription factors like FOXP1 and KLF5 are involved in regulating gene expression. FOXP1 is implicated in the development of several tissues, including the heart and lung, while KLF5 plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Protein Processing and Trafficking: SEC61B is part of the protein translocation apparatus in the endoplasmic reticulum, and KDELR2 is involved in the retrieval of ER-resident proteins. Proteins like CUL4A and UBE4B are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for protein degradation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolism: Enzymes like GDA (guanine deaminase) and GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase) are involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, respectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Immune Response: HLA-DRB1 is an MHC class II cell surface receptor important for the immune system to recognize foreign molecules.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. RNA Processing: Proteins like SRRM1 and DDX54 are involved in RNA splicing and remodeling, which are critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Cell Cycle and Division: NEK2 is a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, and STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Apoptosis and Cell Survival: MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, while TNFSF10 (TRAIL) is a cytokine that induces apoptosis.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. Structural Components: TPM1 is a tropomyosin protein that plays a role in the structure and function of the cytoskeleton.\n",

       "1. The proteins mentioned serve various roles in cellular functions, including but not limited to transcription regulation (e.g., LMO2, NR2F6), signal transduction (e.g., JAK3, RASGRF2), ion transport (e.g., PIEZO2, SLC2A12), and metabolic processes (e.g., DHPS, MGST1).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Some proteins are involved in structural components of the cell or extracellular matrix, such as COL1A2, which is a part of the collagen family contributing to the structural integrity of various tissues.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Others have roles in the immune response (e.g., FAS, MR1), cell cycle regulation (e.g., PRC1), and apoptosis (e.g., IER3).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Several proteins are associated with specific cellular or physiological systems, such as CATSPER2 in sperm cells and FLT1 in angiogenesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. A number of proteins are involved in post-translational modifications, protein folding, and degradation, such as TRIM14, TRIM69, and USP18, which are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. There are also proteins with more specialized functions, such as PCSK5, which is a proprotein convertase, and ABCA4, which is involved in the visual cycle in photoreceptor cells.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying biological process that these proteins collectively contribute to, it is appropriate to conclude that this is a system of unrelated proteins. The proteins listed do not exhibit a coherent interaction network that would suggest a predominant biological process. Therefore, the confidence score for the process name \"System of unrelated proteins\" is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a single, prominent biological process within this group of proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>0.00</td><td>⋯</td><td>FAS;JAK3                                   </td><td>T Cell Homeostasis (GO:0043029)                                                                 </td><td>T Cell Homeostasis                                                                  </td><td>GO:0043029</td><td>NCKAP1L RIPK3 TNFSF14 PPP2R1A PPP2R3C ZC3H8 FOXP3 PPP2CA LGALS2 FAS AKT1 FADD PMAIP1 JAK3 GPR15LG                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>0.2899676</td><td>0.02666667</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td></tr>\n",

Therefore, the most accurate description for this set of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the absence of a common biological process and the heterogeneity of their functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>0.00</td><td>⋯</td><td>SCARB2;ATP8A2                              </td><td>Aminophospholipid Transport (GO:0015917)                                                        </td><td>Aminophospholipid Transport                                                         </td><td>GO:0015917</td><td>SCARB2 TMEM30A TMEM30B ATP8A2 ATP8A1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>0.3593996</td><td>0.04166667</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td></tr>\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular functions such as transcription regulation, intracellular transport, RNA processing, protein degradation, signal transduction, and energy metabolism. Here is a brief analysis of the functional diversity within the system:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Transcription factors and regulators like CREB1, YY1, and various zinc finger proteins (e.g., ZNF562, ZNF283, ZNF420) indicate a role in gene expression regulation, but they likely target different sets of genes given their structural diversity and potential for varied DNA-binding specificities.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins involved in intracellular transport and cellular structure, such as KIF2A (a kinesin involved in microtubule depolymerization) and EPB41L1 (a protein that links the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane), suggest roles in maintaining cellular architecture and dynamics.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. RNA processing and splicing factors like PRPF4B and SART3 are critical for mRNA maturation and regulation of gene expression post-transcriptionally.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Proteins involved in protein degradation and ubiquitination, such as CUL4A and HACE1, indicate involvement in protein quality control and turnover.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Metabolic enzymes and related proteins, such as NDUFS8 (a subunit of mitochondrial complex I) and UQCRFS1 (a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain), suggest roles in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Autophagy-related proteins like BECN1 are involved in cellular degradation and recycling pathways, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Signal transduction proteins like UTS2R (a G-protein coupled receptor) and CTNNBIP1 (an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway) indicate diverse signaling roles.\n",

       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying biological process, it is appropriate to name this system \"System of unrelated proteins\" with a confidence score of 0.00.

       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as TSPEAR, SST (somatostatin), PAX6, and METTL3 are involved in distinct cellular processes. For example, TSPEAR is associated with Notch signaling and development, SST is a hormone that inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones, PAX6 is a key regulatory gene in eye and neural development, and METTL3 is involved in mRNA methylation, impacting RNA stability and translation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like SETMAR, ZMIZ1, and SMAD7 are implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, respectively. These proteins play roles in maintaining genomic integrity, regulating gene expression, and modulating cell signaling pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Proteins such as GNG3 (a G protein subunit), KIF2C (a kinesin involved in mitosis), and STK3 (a serine/threonine kinase) are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and apoptosis, which are fundamental cellular processes but not indicative of a unified biological process within this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Transport and trafficking proteins like SLC19A2 (a thiamine transporter), MAGOH (involved in mRNA splicing and export), and ABCA6 (a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family) highlight the diversity of functions related to cellular transport mechanisms present in this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Proteins such as FERMT1 and ACTR6 are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, respectively, which are critical for cellular structure and motility but do not suggest a common biological process for the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. The presence of non-coding RNA genes like MORC2-AS1 and THAP7-AS1 indicates regulatory roles at the RNA level, adding another layer of functional diversity to the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The inclusion of proteins with poorly characterized functions or those represented by locus names (e.g., LOC100131929, C1ORF213) further complicates the identification of a unified biological process.\n",

       "4. TAP1, PSME2, and HLA-F are involved in antigen processing and presentation. TAP1 is part of the transporter associated with antigen processing, which transports peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. PSME2 is a component of the immunoproteasome that processes antigens for presentation, and HLA-F is a non-classical MHC class I molecule that may be involved in immune regulation.\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, intracellular transport, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Signal transduction and cellular communication are represented by proteins like FGF19 (a member of the fibroblast growth factor family with roles in bile acid synthesis regulation and metabolic homeostasis), EFNB2 (a member of the ephrin family involved in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system), and GPRC5A (a G protein-coupled receptor with potential roles in cancer development).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like GABPA (a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular growth control), RBM39 (an RNA-binding protein implicated in splicing), and TRIM66 (a tripartite motif-containing protein that may function as a transcriptional regulator).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Intracellular transport and cellular organization are represented by proteins such as KIF18A (a kinesin involved in mitotic spindle assembly), STARD4 (involved in cholesterol trafficking), and CAPZA3 (a capping protein regulating actin filament dynamics).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolic processes are covered by proteins like SLC19A1 (a transporter involved in folate uptake), SCP2 (a sterol carrier protein involved in lipid transfer), and MCCC2 (an enzyme in the leucine degradation pathway).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Cell cycle and DNA damage response are represented by RAD9B (involved in cell cycle checkpoint control) and UCHL1 (a deubiquitinating enzyme with roles in protein degradation).\n",
       "\n",

The lack of a unifying theme or process among these proteins leads to the conclusion that this is a system of unrelated proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>0.00</td><td>⋯</td><td>OPN1LW;ATRX                                </td><td>Positive Regulation Of Cell Cycle Process (GO:0090068)                                          </td><td>Positive Regulation Of Cell Cycle Process                                           </td><td>GO:0090068</td><td>GEN1 PDGFRB EGF TAS2R13 SOX15 CDC25B EREG DYNC1LI1 NSFL1C KIF20B PHIP PKP4 RHNO1 MAD2L1 MAP10 OR1A2 UBXN2B CEP120 AURKA NCAPG LRP5 NCAPH AURKC AURKB RACGAP1 CSPP1 E2F7 E2F8 INSR PLK4 NCAPH2 PCID2 STIL XRCC3 PRKCE INO80 IGF1 IGF2 KIF23 ZNF16 NDC80 BTC RGCC PLSCR1 OPN1MW SASS6 BIRC5 RAD18 MAD1L1 OR2A4 NCAPG2 CUL3 NUMA1 CDCA8 CDC14A PDGFB SMC6 SMC4 SMC5 CDC14B RXFP3 SMC2 CDC14C TPR NUP62 CENPV EDN1 RHOA EDN3 MRGPRX2 CDC7 CDC6 SIRT2 SSTR5 OOEP IL1A GIPC1 IL1B INCENP CENPJ RRM2B CD28 GPSM2 KIF14 TGFA RAD21 SPAST OPN1LW CEP295 DRD2 ECT2 MAP3K20 DRD3 NPM2 SVIL RRM1 ATRX RANBP1 DMRT1 SPAG5 DDX11 CIT CDC42 EPGN DBF4 NCAPD2 NCAPD3 PKN2 DYNC1H1 FEN1 WIZ DBF4B CXCR5 INS USP19 NUSAP1 TAS1R2 NUDT16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>0.2442115</td><td>0.01515152</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td><td>FALSE</td></tr>\n",

       "The diversity of these proteins' functions, ranging from structural roles to enzymatic activities and from signal transduction to gene regulation, indicates that they are not collectively dedicated to a singular, well-defined biological process. For example, AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal development, while GCKR (glucokinase regulator) is involved in glucose metabolism. The presence of proteins such as AR (androgen receptor) and CYP19A1 (aromatase, which is involved in steroid metabolism) further illustrates the heterogeneity of the system.\n",

Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Metabolic enzymes such as ABAT, ASS1, and DLD are involved in amino acid metabolism and the citric acid cycle, respectively. These enzymes are crucial for energy production and nitrogen balance.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like CHI3L1 and GAL are associated with inflammation and neurotransmission, indicating roles in immune response and nervous system function.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Transport and structural proteins such as CLDN3, CAV1, and CAV2 are involved in maintaining cellular barriers and modulating signal transduction pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Transcription and translation regulatory proteins like ATF1, EIF4A1, and POLR2K are key components in gene expression and protein synthesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Signal transduction molecules such as PIK3R1 and PTGER4 play roles in various signaling pathways, including those related to cell growth and immune response.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Extracellular matrix and cell adhesion proteins like THBS1 and TNS1 are involved in cell-matrix interactions, which are critical for tissue integrity and repair.\n",

       "To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into pathways that detect and respond to cellular stress and damage. They work in concert to regulate apoptosis, manage oxidative stress, and control cell cycle progression in response to various stress signals. The system's prominent biological process is the coordination of cellular stress responses and the regulation of apoptosis, which is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and systemic functions, including but not limited to, metabolism, signal transduction, structural integrity, gene regulation, and immune responses. A critical analysis of the proteins reveals the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as CYB5A, HSD17B2, and SRD5A1 are involved in metabolic processes, but they act on different substrates and pathways, indicating a lack of a unified metabolic function.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like FCER1A, C3, and CD52 play roles in the immune system, yet they represent different aspects of immune responses and are not indicative of a singular immune-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Transcription factors and gene regulators such as NFATC3, ETS2, and RAD21 are present, but they target a variety of genes and are involved in diverse cellular processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Structural proteins like TUBB2A and cytoskeletal regulators such as CCT2 and CNN3 are included, but they do not suggest a specific structural or motility-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Proteins involved in cell signaling and communication, such as WNT5A, LPAR1, and MET, are part of the system, yet they participate in different signaling pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. There are also proteins with roles in extracellular matrix organization and tissue remodeling, such as SPARC, TIMP2, and EFEMP1, but again, these do not align to a single process.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Transporters and channels like SLC30A1 and SLC16A7 are involved in ion and metabolite transport, but they do not represent a unified transport-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, dominant biological process that these proteins collectively perform, it is appropriate to name this system as a \"System of unrelated proteins\" with a confidence score of 0.00.

       "To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of the immune response, including antigen presentation, chemotaxis, opsonization, and the adaptive immune system. Additionally, several proteins contribute to the organization and function of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for tissue integrity and repair following immune-mediated damage. The interplay between these proteins suggests a system that is primarily engaged in coordinating immune responses and maintaining structural integrity of tissues.

       "2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that control the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. LDLR is responsible for the removal of cholesterol from the bloodstream via endocytosis of lipoprotein particles.\n",

       "3. ACLY (ATP citrate lyase) is an enzyme that converts citrate to acetyl-CoA, a precursor for both the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. ELOVL5 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5) and FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) are involved in the elongation and desaturation of fatty acids, respectively, which are critical steps in the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n",

       "To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of cholesterol and lipids. They participate in the mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and desaturation, and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. The system reflects a coordinated network that ensures the synthesis, uptake, and regulation of lipids and cholesterol, which are vital for membrane structure, energy storage, and signaling molecules.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.\n",

       "2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.\n",
       "\n",
       "To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and molecular functions, including but not limited to:\n",

       "1. Enzymatic activity and metabolism (e.g., AKR1B1, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, AKR7A2, CPS1).\n",
       "2. Immune response and inflammation (e.g., C1QB, CXCL12, CXCL13, CXCL9, HLA-B, IFNAR1, MMP9, S100A9).\n",
       "3. Signal transduction and cell communication (e.g., DKK1, EFNB2, FGFR3, GPR126, LEF1, PDGFRA, PIK3CA).\n",
       "4. Cellular structure and transport (e.g., CAV1, CLU, FLNB, GOLGA8H, KRT7, SLC1A3, SLC26A2).\n",
       "5. Gene regulation and transcription (e.g., CCND1, CDKN1C, KLF9, NR2F2, TFAP2B).\n",
       "6. Neuronal function and development (e.g., GRIA2, NCALD, NRGN, MAP1B).\n",

       "Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a clear, overarching biological process that they collectively contribute to, it is not possible to assign a specific and detailed name to the most prominent biological process performed by this system. The proteins listed do not appear to be functionally integrated into a single, coherent pathway or process based on the information provided.\n",

       "Therefore, the most accurate description for this system of interacting proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the broad spectrum of unrelated functions and the absence of a unifying biological process.

       "To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in a range of processes, but a significant number of them play roles in the cellular response to stress and the regulation of apoptosis. These proteins interact in complex ways to maintain cellular integrity and respond to damage, with implications for cell survival, cell cycle control, and programmed cell death. The confidence score reflects the fact that while many proteins in the system contribute to these processes, not all are directly involved, and the system represents a network with diverse functions.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and molecular functions such as signal transduction, immune response, transcription regulation, cell adhesion, metabolism, and others. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins like HOXB6 (a homeobox protein), NFIB (a transcription factor), and MAFF (a basic leucine zipper transcription factor) are involved in gene expression regulation but do not share a common pathway or target genes.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins such as AGR2 (anterior gradient 2) and TFF1/TFF3 (trefoil factors) are associated with mucosal protection and repair, but their roles are not directly linked to a single, unified process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family and plays a role in developmental processes and cancer, but it does not appear to be functionally integrated with the majority of the other proteins listed.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. The presence of immune-related proteins such as HLA-DOB (an MHC class II protein) and CXCL12 (a chemokine) suggests involvement in immune response, yet this does not represent a primary process for the entire group.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Metabolic enzymes and transporters like ACSL3 (acyl-CoA synthetase) and SLC7A8 (a solute carrier protein) are involved in distinct metabolic pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Structural proteins such as COL9A2 (collagen type IX) and LAMB1 (laminin subunit beta-1) are key for maintaining the integrity of extracellular matrix and basement membranes but are not functionally related to the other proteins in a single process.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Cell signaling and stress response proteins like PLCB3 (phospholipase C beta 3), SGK1 (serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1), and ANXA1 (annexin A1) are involved in various signaling pathways without a common signaling process.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a unifying biological process, it is appropriate to name this system as a \"System of unrelated proteins\" with a confidence score of 0.00,

A critical analysis of the biological processes performed by this system reveals a lack of a unifying biological process that prominently features the majority of these proteins. Here is a breakdown of the functional diversity within the system:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as AKAP12, STK39, and PSD3 are involved in cellular signaling pathways, but they do not converge on a single, predominant signaling process.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like ANXA3, CAV1, and CD44 are associated with cellular structure and adhesion, yet they do not collectively represent a specific structural or adhesion-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. CDKN1C and RPS4Y1 are involved in cell cycle regulation and ribosomal function, respectively, but these functions do not dominate the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolic enzymes such as CYP1B1, DLD, and GMDS participate in various metabolic pathways without a shared primary metabolic process.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Transcriptional regulation is represented by proteins like PBX1 and SOX11, but they are not part of a cohesive transcriptional network within this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Proteins such as HBB and NTS are related to oxygen transport and neurotransmission, which are distinct physiological processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. XIST is involved in X-chromosome inactivation, a process that is not central to the functions of the other proteins in the system.\n",

       "Given the heterogeneity of the functions and the lack of a central biological process that involves a majority of the proteins, it is appropriate to name this system \"System of unrelated proteins\" and assign a confidence score of 0.00.

Several proteins in this system, such as CD44, VCAN (Versican), and CHI3L1 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1), are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. VCAN is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in tissue remodeling and is often upregulated in various cancers.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like EXT1 (Exostosin-1) and XYLT1 (Xylosyltransferase 1) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, respectively. These activities are crucial for the structure and function of the ECM, which is a key component of the tumor microenvironment.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. The presence of proteins such as TNFRSF21 (Death receptor 6) and TNFSF10 (TRAIL) indicates involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways. These proteins can modulate cell death and survival, which are critical processes in cancer progression and response to therapy.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family of proteins that are involved in regulating cell fate and patterning during development. In the context of cancer, WNT5A has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The system includes immune-related proteins such as IGHM, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20, and IGL, which are components of immunoglobulins. These suggest a role in immune surveillance or response within the tumor microenvironment.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Proteins like TGFBR2 (Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II) and S100A6 are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGFBR2 is a key mediator of TGF-beta signaling, which has complex roles in tumor progression, including tumor suppression in early stages and promotion of invasion and metastasis in later stages.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The presence of XIST, a long non-coding RNA involved in X chromosome inactivation, suggests a potential role in epigenetic regulation within the system, although its specific role in this context is less clear.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the proteins in this system are collectively involved in the dynamic modulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly through ECM remodeling, cell adhesion, migration, immune response, and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival. The interplay of these proteins contributes to the structural and functional complexity of the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression and metastasis.

       "Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a unifying theme in their functions, it is not possible to assign a specific biological process that is prominently performed by this system. The proteins listed participate in multiple, distinct pathways and processes, which suggests that they do not form a coherent functional group with a singular biological role.\n",

Several proteins in this system, such as CDC45, CCNF, AURKA, ASF1B, FANCI, CCNB1, KIF2C, CEP170, and ERCC6L, are directly involved in cell cycle regulation and progression. CDC45 is a key player in the initiation of DNA replication, while cyclin F (CCNF) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are essential for the regulation of different phases of the cell cycle. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is critical for mitotic spindle assembly, and KIF2C is involved in chromosome segregation.\n",

       "2. Proteins like EXO1, DEPDC1B, and FANCI are associated with DNA repair mechanisms. EXO1 is a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair and recombination, while FANCI is part of the Fanconi anemia pathway, crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. DEPDC1B has been implicated in the regulation of cell division and may have a role in the DNA damage response.\n",

       "3. The presence of proteins such as ERCC6L, a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair, and ASF1B, which is important for chromatin assembly and disassembly during DNA replication and repair, further supports the involvement of this system in DNA damage response and repair.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. The system also includes proteins like TAF12, which is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, playing a role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and thus indirectly influencing cell cycle progression.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Additionally, proteins such as MYO5A, involved in organelle and vesicle transport, and AQP9, a water channel protein, suggest roles in cellular homeostasis and metabolism that can be critical for cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage.\n",
       "\n",
       "To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally interconnected through their roles in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage response. The system appears to be primarily oriented towards ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic integrity, with additional roles in transcription regulation and cellular transport mechanisms that support these primary functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 0.92 & ⋯ & DEPDC1B;ECT2;TANK;TSPYL5                    & Cellular Response To Ionizing Radiation (GO:0071479)                                             & Cellular Response To Ionizing Radiation                                              & GO:0071479 & KDM4D HUS1 LIG4 SIRT1 RHOB SPIDR MAPK14 DEPDC1B EEF1D RPL26 RHNO1 ATR TP53 YAP1 KDM1A SWI5 BRCA1 BRCA2 TANK BABAM2 RAD51AP1 PRAP1 HSF1 IFI16 ECT2 MAP3K20 XRCC5 XRCC6 GADD45A INO80 RAD51 ERCC4 GRB2 INTS7 CRYAB CLOCK RAD9A TSPYL5 MDM2 RAD9B BLM CDKN1A NUCKS1 SLC6A2 NIPBL WRN FIGNL1 TMEM109 TLK2 HRAS TNKS1BP1 BARD1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & 0.5655439 & 0.02797203 & TRUE  & FALSE & FALSE\\\\\n",

This reflects the absence of a unifying process that characterizes the majority of the proteins in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0.00 & ⋯ & RPTOR;STARD4;IRS1                           & Positive Regulation Of Small Molecule Metabolic Process (GO:0062013)                             & Positive Regulation Of Small Molecule Metabolic Process                              & GO:0062013 & GPLD1 INSR STARD4 PRKCE ARNT IGF1 MTOR P2RX7 APOA1 MLXIPL PRXL2C IFNG GAPDHS APP CES1 PRKAA2 SLC45A3 IRS1 IRS2 ADM PSEN1 HIF1A INS SLC4A4 PRKAA1 ZBTB20 RPTOR MLST8 AKT1 AKT2 APOE PMAIP1 LDLRAP1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 0.2417308 & 0.02459016 & FALSE & FALSE & FALSE\\\\\n",

The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Proteins such as SLC34A1, SLC15A3, and SLC23A2 are transporters that facilitate the movement of specific substrates across cellular membranes. SLC34A1 is a phosphate transporter, SLC15A3 is a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, and SLC23A2 is a vitamin C transporter.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The presence of proteins like IDH3A, LDHB, and GYS1 indicates involvement in metabolic processes. IDH3A is a subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase involved in the TCA cycle, LDHB is involved in lactate metabolism, and GYS1 is glycogen synthase, which plays a role in glycogen biosynthesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Proteins such as OPTN, CEACAM1, and PLAUR are implicated in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions. OPTN is involved in autophagy and NF-κB signaling, CEACAM1 participates in cell adhesion and signaling, and PLAUR (uPAR) is involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling.\n",
       "\n",
       "To summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.\n",

WDR16, or WD repeat domain 16, is a protein that is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and may play a role in autophagy. The specific functions of WDR16 are not well-characterized, but given its domain structure, it is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate signal transduction pathways or assembly of protein complexes.\n",

       "2. GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to internal signaling pathways. The gamma subunit, along with the beta subunit, forms a complex that interacts with the alpha subunit and receptors. GNG12 is implicated in the modulation of various signaling cascades, including those that regulate cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and possibly angiogenesis.\n",

       "3. NSMAF, also known as neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activation associated factor, is involved in the ceramide signaling pathway. Ceramide is a lipid molecule that acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling cascades, particularly those related to stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis. NSMAF is thought to be involved in the activation of N-SMase, which leads to the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin.\n",

       "To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling. WDR16 may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes or pathways, GNG12 is directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and NSMAF is associated with lipid signaling pathways. While the specific interactions between these proteins are not well-defined, their collective involvement in signaling suggests a role in modulating intracellular communication and response to external stimuli. The confidence score reflects the fact that while each protein is involved in signaling, the direct connections and integration of their functions within a single, prominent biological process are not fully established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 0.75 & ⋯ & NSMAF                                       & Ceramide Metabolic Process (GO:0006672)                                                          & Ceramide Metabolic Process                                                           & GO:0006672 & TLCD3B AGK PPP2R1A DEGS2 DEGS1 NSMAF ASAH2 SAMD8 ST6GALNAC3 SGMS2 CERK SGMS1 ALOX12B CYP4F22 FUT3 ASAH1 FUT5 FUT7 FUT6 SGPL1 ORMDL3 SPTSSA SPTSSB ALOXE3 ABCA2 CERS4 CERS5 CERS6 GDF1 CEL ORMDL1 ORMDL2 PPP2CA ACER3 FA2H ACER2 TM9SF2 ACER1 PLA2G15 PLPP3 PNPLA1 CERS2 PLPP2 ST6GALNAC6 CERS3 PLPP1 GBA1 CLN8 CLN6 SMPD4 SPTLC1 SPTLC2 SPTLC3 SMPD2 SMPD1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & 0.3533867 & 0.01754386 & FALSE & FALSE & FALSE\\\\\n",

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The proteins span multiple cellular compartments and systems, including transcription factors (FOXM1, HNF4G, SP2), enzymes (LDHA, ACHE, FN3K), structural proteins (KRT39), and receptors (CXCR4, OR7A5).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Some proteins are involved in signal transduction and immune responses (CXCR4, IL6, CCL2), while others are implicated in metabolic processes (LDHA, ACHE, GYG1).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Several proteins have roles in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (CDC7, WEE1, FOXM1), whereas others are involved in neuronal development and function (NELL2, PDYN, PCP4L1).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. A few proteins are associated with specific diseases or conditions, such as NPC2 with Niemann-Pick disease and G6PC3 with severe congenital neutropenia.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. There are proteins that are less characterized or have unknown functions (LOC100128002, KIAA1377), which further complicates the identification of a common biological process.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. The list includes proteins that are part of the ribosomal machinery (RPL22, RPL38) and protein synthesis (EIF3E, NAA10), but these do not represent a majority of the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear majority of proteins participating in a single, coherent biological process, it is appropriate to conclude that this system does not revolve around a central biological theme. Therefore, the most accurate description for this group of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the absence of a unifying biological process. The confidence score assigned to this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a prominent biological process within this system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 0.00 & ⋯ & HSP90AA1;STUB1;PARK7;TPPP                   & Positive Regulation Of Protein-Containing Complex Assembly (GO:0031334)                          & Positive Regulation Of Protein-Containing Complex Assembly                           & GO:0031334 & TGFB1 BIK SH3GLB1 UNC13B MED9 PSMC6 CXCL13 DEPDC1B TRABD2A BAX AJUBA SKAP1 TP53 TRABD2B CSF2 CLU PARK7 TNF RASIP1 BCL2L11 CDH5 DHX33 RPS3 GBP2 GBP5 SNCA NEK7 TIRAP ISG15 TERF1 FERMT1 FERMT2 MYD88 MAVS EIF4G1 PRKD1 BTK CDC42EP2 FSCN1 TTBK1 VCP TFRC PIEZO1 ICE1 LGALS3 CHAF1B TCL1A USP50 BMF PLCG2 MARK4 HSP90AA1 MMP1 MMP3 NRG1 SPIDR VEGFA RHOC GNL3L IL5 TPPP2 TPPP3 LCP1 TAL1 IFNG ATM TLR6 ATR TLR4 HRK DDX3X GSK3B PTPN22 BRK1 MTLN RAP1B CLEC7A STMP1 CD36 FNIP2 TPPP FNIP1 SLF2 SLF1 SYK WARS1 DAB2IP PPP2CA STUB1 SRC PLEK FAF1 CAPG MAPK8 SUMO1 BAK1 RACK1 BID                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 0.3543378 & 0.02116402 & FALSE & FALSE & FALSE\\\\\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, protein processing, cellular metabolism, and immune responses. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Signal Transduction: Proteins like MAP3K7, GPR110, and TNFRSF11A are involved in different signaling pathways. MAP3K7 is a kinase that plays a role in the NF-kappaB pathway, while GPR110 is a G protein-coupled receptor, and TNFRSF11A is a receptor for TNFSF11/RANKL and is important for osteoclastogenesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Gene Regulation: Transcription factors like FOXP1 and KLF5 are involved in regulating gene expression. FOXP1 is implicated in the development of several tissues, including the heart and lung, while KLF5 plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Protein Processing and Trafficking: SEC61B is part of the protein translocation apparatus in the endoplasmic reticulum, and KDELR2 is involved in the retrieval of ER-resident proteins. Proteins like CUL4A and UBE4B are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for protein degradation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolism: Enzymes like GDA (guanine deaminase) and GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase) are involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, respectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Immune Response: HLA-DRB1 is an MHC class II cell surface receptor important for the immune system to recognize foreign molecules.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. RNA Processing: Proteins like SRRM1 and DDX54 are involved in RNA splicing and remodeling, which are critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Cell Cycle and Division: NEK2 is a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, and STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Apoptosis and Cell Survival: MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, while TNFSF10 (TRAIL) is a cytokine that induces apoptosis.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. Structural Components: TPM1 is a tropomyosin protein that plays a role in the structure and function of the cytoskeleton.\n",

       "1. The proteins mentioned serve various roles in cellular functions, including but not limited to transcription regulation (e.g., LMO2, NR2F6), signal transduction (e.g., JAK3, RASGRF2), ion transport (e.g., PIEZO2, SLC2A12), and metabolic processes (e.g., DHPS, MGST1).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Some proteins are involved in structural components of the cell or extracellular matrix, such as COL1A2, which is a part of the collagen family contributing to the structural integrity of various tissues.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Others have roles in the immune response (e.g., FAS, MR1), cell cycle regulation (e.g., PRC1), and apoptosis (e.g., IER3).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Several proteins are associated with specific cellular or physiological systems, such as CATSPER2 in sperm cells and FLT1 in angiogenesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. A number of proteins are involved in post-translational modifications, protein folding, and degradation, such as TRIM14, TRIM69, and USP18, which are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. There are also proteins with more specialized functions, such as PCSK5, which is a proprotein convertase, and ABCA4, which is involved in the visual cycle in photoreceptor cells.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying biological process that these proteins collectively contribute to, it is appropriate to conclude that this is a system of unrelated proteins. The proteins listed do not exhibit a coherent interaction network that would suggest a predominant biological process. Therefore, the confidence score for the process name \"System of unrelated proteins\" is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a single, prominent biological process within this group of proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & 0.00 & ⋯ & FAS;JAK3                                    & T Cell Homeostasis (GO:0043029)                                                                  & T Cell Homeostasis                                                                   & GO:0043029 & NCKAP1L RIPK3 TNFSF14 PPP2R1A PPP2R3C ZC3H8 FOXP3 PPP2CA LGALS2 FAS AKT1 FADD PMAIP1 JAK3 GPR15LG                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 0.2899676 & 0.02666667 & FALSE & FALSE & FALSE\\\\\n",

Therefore, the most accurate description for this set of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the absence of a common biological process and the heterogeneity of their functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & 0.00 & ⋯ & SCARB2;ATP8A2                               & Aminophospholipid Transport (GO:0015917)                                                         & Aminophospholipid Transport                                                          & GO:0015917 & SCARB2 TMEM30A TMEM30B ATP8A2 ATP8A1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & 0.3593996 & 0.04166667 & FALSE & FALSE & FALSE\\\\\n",

Therefore, the most accurate description of this set of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the absence of a predominant biological process and the diverse nature of their functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & 0.00 & ⋯ & CCDC91;AP1G1                                & Golgi To Lysosome Transport (GO:0090160)                                                         & Golgi To Lysosome Transport                                                          & GO:0090160 & AP4M1 EHD3 GAK AP1G1 CCDC91 CLN3 SORT1 LAMP1 ASB15 LAPTM5 RBSN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & 0.3329341 & 0.03278689 & FALSE & FALSE & FALSE\\\\\n",

       "1. Transcription factors and regulators like CREB1, YY1, and various zinc finger proteins (e.g., ZNF562, ZNF283, ZNF420) indicate a role in gene expression regulation, but they likely target different sets of genes given their structural diversity and potential for varied DNA-binding specificities.\n",

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as TSPEAR, SST (somatostatin), PAX6, and METTL3 are involved in distinct cellular processes. For example, TSPEAR is associated with Notch signaling and development, SST is a hormone that inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones, PAX6 is a key regulatory gene in eye and neural development, and METTL3 is involved in mRNA methylation, impacting RNA stability and translation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like SETMAR, ZMIZ1, and SMAD7 are implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, respectively. These proteins play roles in maintaining genomic integrity, regulating gene expression, and modulating cell signaling pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Proteins such as GNG3 (a G protein subunit), KIF2C (a kinesin involved in mitosis), and STK3 (a serine/threonine kinase) are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and apoptosis, which are fundamental cellular processes but not indicative of a unified biological process within this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Transport and trafficking proteins like SLC19A2 (a thiamine transporter), MAGOH (involved in mRNA splicing and export), and ABCA6 (a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family) highlight the diversity of functions related to cellular transport mechanisms present in this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Proteins such as FERMT1 and ACTR6 are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, respectively, which are critical for cellular structure and motility but do not suggest a common biological process for the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. The presence of non-coding RNA genes like MORC2-AS1 and THAP7-AS1 indicates regulatory roles at the RNA level, adding another layer of functional diversity to the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The inclusion of proteins with poorly characterized functions or those represented by locus names (e.g., LOC100131929, C1ORF213) further complicates the identification of a unified biological process.\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, intracellular transport, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Signal transduction and cellular communication are represented by proteins like FGF19 (a member of the fibroblast growth factor family with roles in bile acid synthesis regulation and metabolic homeostasis), EFNB2 (a member of the ephrin family involved in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system), and GPRC5A (a G protein-coupled receptor with potential roles in cancer development).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like GABPA (a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular growth control), RBM39 (an RNA-binding protein implicated in splicing), and TRIM66 (a tripartite motif-containing protein that may function as a transcriptional regulator).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Intracellular transport and cellular organization are represented by proteins such as KIF18A (a kinesin involved in mitotic spindle assembly), STARD4 (involved in cholesterol trafficking), and CAPZA3 (a capping protein regulating actin filament dynamics).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolic processes are covered by proteins like SLC19A1 (a transporter involved in folate uptake), SCP2 (a sterol carrier protein involved in lipid transfer), and MCCC2 (an enzyme in the leucine degradation pathway).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Cell cycle and DNA damage response are represented by RAD9B (involved in cell cycle checkpoint control) and UCHL1 (a deubiquitinating enzyme with roles in protein degradation).\n",
       "\n",

The lack of a unifying theme or process among these proteins leads to the conclusion that this is a system of unrelated proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 0.00 & ⋯ & OPN1LW;ATRX                                 & Positive Regulation Of Cell Cycle Process (GO:0090068)                                           & Positive Regulation Of Cell Cycle Process                                            & GO:0090068 & GEN1 PDGFRB EGF TAS2R13 SOX15 CDC25B EREG DYNC1LI1 NSFL1C KIF20B PHIP PKP4 RHNO1 MAD2L1 MAP10 OR1A2 UBXN2B CEP120 AURKA NCAPG LRP5 NCAPH AURKC AURKB RACGAP1 CSPP1 E2F7 E2F8 INSR PLK4 NCAPH2 PCID2 STIL XRCC3 PRKCE INO80 IGF1 IGF2 KIF23 ZNF16 NDC80 BTC RGCC PLSCR1 OPN1MW SASS6 BIRC5 RAD18 MAD1L1 OR2A4 NCAPG2 CUL3 NUMA1 CDCA8 CDC14A PDGFB SMC6 SMC4 SMC5 CDC14B RXFP3 SMC2 CDC14C TPR NUP62 CENPV EDN1 RHOA EDN3 MRGPRX2 CDC7 CDC6 SIRT2 SSTR5 OOEP IL1A GIPC1 IL1B INCENP CENPJ RRM2B CD28 GPSM2 KIF14 TGFA RAD21 SPAST OPN1LW CEP295 DRD2 ECT2 MAP3K20 DRD3 NPM2 SVIL RRM1 ATRX RANBP1 DMRT1 SPAG5 DDX11 CIT CDC42 EPGN DBF4 NCAPD2 NCAPD3 PKN2 DYNC1H1 FEN1 WIZ DBF4B CXCR5 INS USP19 NUSAP1 TAS1R2 NUDT16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & 0.2442115 & 0.01515152 & FALSE & FALSE & FALSE\\\\\n",

       "The diversity of these proteins' functions, ranging from structural roles to enzymatic activities and from signal transduction to gene regulation, indicates that they are not collectively dedicated to a singular, well-defined biological process. For example, AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal development, while GCKR (glucokinase regulator) is involved in glucose metabolism. The presence of proteins such as AR (androgen receptor) and CYP19A1 (aromatase, which is involved in steroid metabolism) further illustrates the heterogeneity of the system.\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities, including but not limited to metabolism, signal transduction, gene expression regulation, and structural integrity. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Metabolic enzymes such as ABAT, ASS1, and DLD are involved in amino acid metabolism and the citric acid cycle, respectively. These enzymes are crucial for energy production and nitrogen balance.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like CHI3L1 and GAL are associated with inflammation and neurotransmission, indicating roles in immune response and nervous system function.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Transport and structural proteins such as CLDN3, CAV1, and CAV2 are involved in maintaining cellular barriers and modulating signal transduction pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Transcription and translation regulatory proteins like ATF1, EIF4A1, and POLR2K are key components in gene expression and protein synthesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Signal transduction molecules such as PIK3R1 and PTGER4 play roles in various signaling pathways, including those related to cell growth and immune response.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Extracellular matrix and cell adhesion proteins like THBS1 and TNS1 are involved in cell-matrix interactions, which are critical for tissue integrity and repair.\n",

A critical analysis of their roles reveals no clear, singular biological process that is prominently performed by the majority of these proteins. Instead, they are involved in a wide range of cellular activities, including but not limited to:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Cell signaling and adhesion: Proteins such as CD44 and CD9 are involved in cell-cell interactions and signaling. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and migration, while CD9 is a member of the tetraspanin family that plays a role in cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Hormone and growth factor activity: ADM (Adrenomedullin) and VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A) are involved in vasodilation and angiogenesis, respectively. These proteins contribute to processes such as blood vessel formation and the regulation of blood pressure.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Metabolism and detoxification: Enzymes like CYP4B1 (a member of the cytochrome P450 family) and GSTA1 (Glutathione S-transferase alpha 1) are involved in the metabolism of lipids and xenobiotics, as well as in the detoxification of harmful substances.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Immune response and inflammation: Proteins such as CCL18 (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18) and SELENBP1 (Selenium-binding protein 1) have roles in immune responses and inflammation. CCL18 is a chemokine that attracts immune cells, while SELENBP1 has been implicated in cellular responses to oxidative stress.\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and systemic functions, including but not limited to, metabolism, signal transduction, structural integrity, gene regulation, and immune responses. A critical analysis of the proteins reveals the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as CYB5A, HSD17B2, and SRD5A1 are involved in metabolic processes, but they act on different substrates and pathways, indicating a lack of a unified metabolic function.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like FCER1A, C3, and CD52 play roles in the immune system, yet they represent different aspects of immune responses and are not indicative of a singular immune-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Transcription factors and gene regulators such as NFATC3, ETS2, and RAD21 are present, but they target a variety of genes and are involved in diverse cellular processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Structural proteins like TUBB2A and cytoskeletal regulators such as CCT2 and CNN3 are included, but they do not suggest a specific structural or motility-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Proteins involved in cell signaling and communication, such as WNT5A, LPAR1, and MET, are part of the system, yet they participate in different signaling pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. There are also proteins with roles in extracellular matrix organization and tissue remodeling, such as SPARC, TIMP2, and EFEMP1, but again, these do not align to a single process.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Transporters and channels like SLC30A1 and SLC16A7 are involved in ion and metabolite transport, but they do not represent a unified transport-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, dominant biological process that these proteins collectively perform, it is appropriate to name this system as a \"System of unrelated proteins\" with a confidence score of 0.00.

       "To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of the immune response, including antigen presentation, chemotaxis, opsonization, and the adaptive immune system. Additionally, several proteins contribute to the organization and function of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for tissue integrity and repair following immune-mediated damage. The interplay between these proteins suggests a system that is primarily engaged in coordinating immune responses and maintaining structural integrity of tissues.

       "2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that control the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. LDLR is responsible for the removal of cholesterol from the bloodstream via endocytosis of lipoprotein particles.\n",

       "3. ACLY (ATP citrate lyase) is an enzyme that converts citrate to acetyl-CoA, a precursor for both the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. ELOVL5 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5) and FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) are involved in the elongation and desaturation of fatty acids, respectively, which are critical steps in the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n",

       "To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of cholesterol and lipids. They participate in the mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and desaturation, and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. The system reflects a coordinated network that ensures the synthesis, uptake, and regulation of lipids and cholesterol, which are vital for membrane structure, energy storage, and signaling molecules.

Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.\n",
       "\n",
       "To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and molecular functions, including but not limited to:\n",

       "1. Enzymatic activity and metabolism (e.g., AKR1B1, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, AKR7A2, CPS1).\n",

       "3. Signal transduction and cell communication (e.g., DKK1, EFNB2, FGFR3, GPR126, LEF1, PDGFRA, PIK3CA).\n",
       "4. Cellular structure and transport (e.g., CAV1, CLU, FLNB, GOLGA8H, KRT7, SLC1A3, SLC26A2).\n",
       "5. Gene regulation and transcription (e.g., CCND1, CDKN1C, KLF9, NR2F2, TFAP2B).\n",

       "Given the diversity of these proteins and the lack of a clear, overarching biological process that they collectively contribute to, it is not possible to assign a specific and detailed name to the most prominent biological process performed by this system. The proteins listed do not appear to be functionally integrated into a single, coherent pathway or process based on the information provided.\n",

       "Therefore, the most accurate description for this system of interacting proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the broad spectrum of unrelated functions and the absence of a unifying biological process.

       "To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in a range of processes, but a significant number of them play roles in the cellular response to stress and the regulation of apoptosis. These proteins interact in complex ways to maintain cellular integrity and respond to damage, with implications for cell survival, cell cycle control, and programmed cell death. The confidence score reflects the fact that while many proteins in the system contribute to these processes, not all are directly involved, and the system represents a network with diverse functions.

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular and molecular functions such as signal transduction, immune response, transcription regulation, cell adhesion, metabolism, and others. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins like HOXB6 (a homeobox protein), NFIB (a transcription factor), and MAFF (a basic leucine zipper transcription factor) are involved in gene expression regulation but do not share a common pathway or target genes.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins such as AGR2 (anterior gradient 2) and TFF1/TFF3 (trefoil factors) are associated with mucosal protection and repair, but their roles are not directly linked to a single, unified process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family and plays a role in developmental processes and cancer, but it does not appear to be functionally integrated with the majority of the other proteins listed.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. The presence of immune-related proteins such as HLA-DOB (an MHC class II protein) and CXCL12 (a chemokine) suggests involvement in immune response, yet this does not represent a primary process for the entire group.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Metabolic enzymes and transporters like ACSL3 (acyl-CoA synthetase) and SLC7A8 (a solute carrier protein) are involved in distinct metabolic pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Structural proteins such as COL9A2 (collagen type IX) and LAMB1 (laminin subunit beta-1) are key for maintaining the integrity of extracellular matrix and basement membranes but are not functionally related to the other proteins in a single process.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Cell signaling and stress response proteins like PLCB3 (phospholipase C beta 3), SGK1 (serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1), and ANXA1 (annexin A1) are involved in various signaling pathways without a common signaling process.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a unifying biological process, it is appropriate to name this system as a \"System of unrelated proteins\" with a confidence score of 0.00,

A critical analysis of the biological processes performed by this system reveals a lack of a unifying biological process that prominently features the majority of these proteins. Here is a breakdown of the functional diversity within the system:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as AKAP12, STK39, and PSD3 are involved in cellular signaling pathways, but they do not converge on a single, predominant signaling process.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like ANXA3, CAV1, and CD44 are associated with cellular structure and adhesion, yet they do not collectively represent a specific structural or adhesion-related process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. CDKN1C and RPS4Y1 are involved in cell cycle regulation and ribosomal function, respectively, but these functions do not dominate the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolic enzymes such as CYP1B1, DLD, and GMDS participate in various metabolic pathways without a shared primary metabolic process.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Transcriptional regulation is represented by proteins like PBX1 and SOX11, but they are not part of a cohesive transcriptional network within this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Proteins such as HBB and NTS are related to oxygen transport and neurotransmission, which are distinct physiological processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. XIST is involved in X-chromosome inactivation, a process that is not central to the functions of the other proteins in the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the heterogeneity of the functions and the lack of a central biological process that involves a majority of the proteins, it is appropriate to name this system \"System of unrelated proteins\" and assign a confidence score of 0.00. This reflects the absence of a single, prominent biological process that characterizes the interactions of these proteins.

Several proteins in this system, such as CD44, VCAN (Versican), and CHI3L1 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1), are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. VCAN is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in tissue remodeling and is often upregulated in various cancers.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like EXT1 (Exostosin-1) and XYLT1 (Xylosyltransferase 1) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, respectively. These activities are crucial for the structure and function of the ECM, which is a key component of the tumor microenvironment.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. The presence of proteins such as TNFRSF21 (Death receptor 6) and TNFSF10 (TRAIL) indicates involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways. These proteins can modulate cell death and survival, which are critical processes in cancer progression and response to therapy.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family of proteins that are involved in regulating cell fate and patterning during development. In the context of cancer, WNT5A has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The system includes immune-related proteins such as IGHM, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20, and IGL, which are components of immunoglobulins. These suggest a role in immune surveillance or response within the tumor microenvironment.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Proteins like TGFBR2 (Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II) and S100A6 are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGFBR2 is a key mediator of TGF-beta signaling, which has complex roles in tumor progression, including tumor suppression in early stages and promotion of invasion and metastasis in later stages.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The presence of XIST, a long non-coding RNA involved in X chromosome inactivation, suggests a potential role in epigenetic regulation within the system, although its specific role in this context is less clear.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the proteins in this system are collectively involved in the dynamic modulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly through ECM remodeling, cell adhesion, migration, immune response, and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival. The interplay of these proteins contributes to the structural and functional complexity of the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression and metastasis.

Other proteins such as AZGP1, GOLM1, LXN, MBNL1, PRAME, SRGN, TFF1, CYP4B1, FAR2, FCGBP, FLRT3, GRN, IFI27, and SLC39A8 have various functions ranging from metabolism, cell adhesion, RNA binding, to protein folding. While they may not directly interact with the immune system, their roles could indirectly affect immune cell function or be involved in pathways that intersect with immune signaling.\n",

Several proteins in this system, such as CDC45, CCNF, AURKA, ASF1B, FANCI, CCNB1, KIF2C, CEP170, and ERCC6L, are directly involved in cell cycle regulation and progression. CDC45 is a key player in the initiation of DNA replication, while cyclin F (CCNF) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are essential for the regulation of different phases of the cell cycle. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is critical for mitotic spindle assembly, and KIF2C is involved in chromosome segregation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like EXO1, DEPDC1B, and FANCI are associated with DNA repair mechanisms. EXO1 is a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair and recombination, while FANCI is part of the Fanconi anemia pathway, crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. DEPDC1B has been implicated in the regulation of cell division and may have a role in the DNA damage response.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. The presence of proteins such as ERCC6L, a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair, and ASF1B, which is important for chromatin assembly and disassembly during DNA replication and repair, further supports the involvement of this system in DNA damage response and repair.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. The system also includes proteins like TAF12, which is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, playing a role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and thus indirectly influencing cell cycle progression.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Additionally, proteins such as MYO5A, involved in organelle and vesicle transport, and AQP9, a water channel protein, suggest roles in cellular homeostasis and metabolism that can be critical for cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage.\n",
       "\n",
       "To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally interconnected through their roles in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage response. The system appears to be primarily oriented towards ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic integrity, with additional roles in transcription regulation and cellular transport mechanisms that support these primary functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 0.92 | ⋯ | DEPDC1B;ECT2;TANK;TSPYL5                    | Cellular Response To Ionizing Radiation (GO:0071479)                                             | Cellular Response To Ionizing Radiation                                              | GO:0071479 | KDM4D HUS1 LIG4 SIRT1 RHOB SPIDR MAPK14 DEPDC1B EEF1D RPL26 RHNO1 ATR TP53 YAP1 KDM1A SWI5 BRCA1 BRCA2 TANK BABAM2 RAD51AP1 PRAP1 HSF1 IFI16 ECT2 MAP3K20 XRCC5 XRCC6 GADD45A INO80 RAD51 ERCC4 GRB2 INTS7 CRYAB CLOCK RAD9A TSPYL5 MDM2 RAD9B BLM CDKN1A NUCKS1 SLC6A2 NIPBL WRN FIGNL1 TMEM109 TLK2 HRAS TNKS1BP1 BARD1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 0.5655439 | 0.02797203 | TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

This reflects the absence of a unifying process that characterizes the majority of the proteins in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0.00 | ⋯ | RPTOR;STARD4;IRS1                           | Positive Regulation Of Small Molecule Metabolic Process (GO:0062013)                             | Positive Regulation Of Small Molecule Metabolic Process                              | GO:0062013 | GPLD1 INSR STARD4 PRKCE ARNT IGF1 MTOR P2RX7 APOA1 MLXIPL PRXL2C IFNG GAPDHS APP CES1 PRKAA2 SLC45A3 IRS1 IRS2 ADM PSEN1 HIF1A INS SLC4A4 PRKAA1 ZBTB20 RPTOR MLST8 AKT1 AKT2 APOE PMAIP1 LDLRAP1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 0.2417308 | 0.02459016 | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Proteins such as SLC34A1, SLC15A3, and SLC23A2 are transporters that facilitate the movement of specific substrates across cellular membranes. SLC34A1 is a phosphate transporter, SLC15A3 is a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, and SLC23A2 is a vitamin C transporter.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The presence of proteins like IDH3A, LDHB, and GYS1 indicates involvement in metabolic processes. IDH3A is a subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase involved in the TCA cycle, LDHB is involved in lactate metabolism, and GYS1 is glycogen synthase, which plays a role in glycogen biosynthesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Proteins such as OPTN, CEACAM1, and PLAUR are implicated in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions. OPTN is involved in autophagy and NF-κB signaling, CEACAM1 participates in cell adhesion and signaling, and PLAUR (uPAR) is involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling.\n",
       "\n",
       "To summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the complexity and diversity of the protein functions, the confidence score is not at the maximum, as not all proteins are directly involved in the identified processes.

WDR16, or WD repeat domain 16, is a protein that is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and may play a role in autophagy. The specific functions of WDR16 are not well-characterized, but given its domain structure, it is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate signal transduction pathways or assembly of protein complexes.\n",

       "2. GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to internal signaling pathways. The gamma subunit, along with the beta subunit, forms a complex that interacts with the alpha subunit and receptors. GNG12 is implicated in the modulation of various signaling cascades, including those that regulate cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and possibly angiogenesis.\n",

       "3. NSMAF, also known as neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activation associated factor, is involved in the ceramide signaling pathway. Ceramide is a lipid molecule that acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling cascades, particularly those related to stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis. NSMAF is thought to be involved in the activation of N-SMase, which leads to the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin.\n",

       "To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling. WDR16 may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes or pathways, GNG12 is directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and NSMAF is associated with lipid signaling pathways. While the specific interactions between these proteins are not well-defined, their collective involvement in signaling suggests a role in modulating intracellular communication and response to external stimuli. The confidence score reflects the fact that while each protein is involved in signaling, the direct connections and integration of their functions within a single, prominent biological process are not fully established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 0.75 | ⋯ | NSMAF                                       | Ceramide Metabolic Process (GO:0006672)                                                          | Ceramide Metabolic Process                                                           | GO:0006672 | TLCD3B AGK PPP2R1A DEGS2 DEGS1 NSMAF ASAH2 SAMD8 ST6GALNAC3 SGMS2 CERK SGMS1 ALOX12B CYP4F22 FUT3 ASAH1 FUT5 FUT7 FUT6 SGPL1 ORMDL3 SPTSSA SPTSSB ALOXE3 ABCA2 CERS4 CERS5 CERS6 GDF1 CEL ORMDL1 ORMDL2 PPP2CA ACER3 FA2H ACER2 TM9SF2 ACER1 PLA2G15 PLPP3 PNPLA1 CERS2 PLPP2 ST6GALNAC6 CERS3 PLPP1 GBA1 CLN8 CLN6 SMPD4 SPTLC1 SPTLC2 SPTLC3 SMPD2 SMPD1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 0.3533867 | 0.01754386 | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The proteins span multiple cellular compartments and systems, including transcription factors (FOXM1, HNF4G, SP2), enzymes (LDHA, ACHE, FN3K), structural proteins (KRT39), and receptors (CXCR4, OR7A5).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Some proteins are involved in signal transduction and immune responses (CXCR4, IL6, CCL2), while others are implicated in metabolic processes (LDHA, ACHE, GYG1).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Several proteins have roles in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (CDC7, WEE1, FOXM1), whereas others are involved in neuronal development and function (NELL2, PDYN, PCP4L1).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. A few proteins are associated with specific diseases or conditions, such as NPC2 with Niemann-Pick disease and G6PC3 with severe congenital neutropenia.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. There are proteins that are less characterized or have unknown functions (LOC100128002, KIAA1377), which further complicates the identification of a common biological process.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. The list includes proteins that are part of the ribosomal machinery (RPL22, RPL38) and protein synthesis (EIF3E, NAA10), but these do not represent a majority of the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear majority of proteins participating in a single, coherent biological process, it is appropriate to conclude that this system does not revolve around a central biological theme. Therefore, the most accurate description for this group of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the absence of a unifying biological process. The confidence score assigned to this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a prominent biological process within this system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 0.00 | ⋯ | HSP90AA1;STUB1;PARK7;TPPP                   | Positive Regulation Of Protein-Containing Complex Assembly (GO:0031334)                          | Positive Regulation Of Protein-Containing Complex Assembly                           | GO:0031334 | TGFB1 BIK SH3GLB1 UNC13B MED9 PSMC6 CXCL13 DEPDC1B TRABD2A BAX AJUBA SKAP1 TP53 TRABD2B CSF2 CLU PARK7 TNF RASIP1 BCL2L11 CDH5 DHX33 RPS3 GBP2 GBP5 SNCA NEK7 TIRAP ISG15 TERF1 FERMT1 FERMT2 MYD88 MAVS EIF4G1 PRKD1 BTK CDC42EP2 FSCN1 TTBK1 VCP TFRC PIEZO1 ICE1 LGALS3 CHAF1B TCL1A USP50 BMF PLCG2 MARK4 HSP90AA1 MMP1 MMP3 NRG1 SPIDR VEGFA RHOC GNL3L IL5 TPPP2 TPPP3 LCP1 TAL1 IFNG ATM TLR6 ATR TLR4 HRK DDX3X GSK3B PTPN22 BRK1 MTLN RAP1B CLEC7A STMP1 CD36 FNIP2 TPPP FNIP1 SLF2 SLF1 SYK WARS1 DAB2IP PPP2CA STUB1 SRC PLEK FAF1 CAPG MAPK8 SUMO1 BAK1 RACK1 BID                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 0.3543378 | 0.02116402 | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, protein processing, cellular metabolism, and immune responses. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Signal Transduction: Proteins like MAP3K7, GPR110, and TNFRSF11A are involved in different signaling pathways. MAP3K7 is a kinase that plays a role in the NF-kappaB pathway, while GPR110 is a G protein-coupled receptor, and TNFRSF11A is a receptor for TNFSF11/RANKL and is important for osteoclastogenesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Gene Regulation: Transcription factors like FOXP1 and KLF5 are involved in regulating gene expression. FOXP1 is implicated in the development of several tissues, including the heart and lung, while KLF5 plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Protein Processing and Trafficking: SEC61B is part of the protein translocation apparatus in the endoplasmic reticulum, and KDELR2 is involved in the retrieval of ER-resident proteins. Proteins like CUL4A and UBE4B are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for protein degradation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolism: Enzymes like GDA (guanine deaminase) and GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase) are involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, respectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Immune Response: HLA-DRB1 is an MHC class II cell surface receptor important for the immune system to recognize foreign molecules.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. RNA Processing: Proteins like SRRM1 and DDX54 are involved in RNA splicing and remodeling, which are critical for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Cell Cycle and Division: NEK2 is a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, and STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Apoptosis and Cell Survival: MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, while TNFSF10 (TRAIL) is a cytokine that induces apoptosis.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. Structural Components: TPM1 is a tropomyosin protein that plays a role in the structure and function of the cytoskeleton.\n",

       "1. The proteins mentioned serve various roles in cellular functions, including but not limited to transcription regulation (e.g., LMO2, NR2F6), signal transduction (e.g., JAK3, RASGRF2), ion transport (e.g., PIEZO2, SLC2A12), and metabolic processes (e.g., DHPS, MGST1).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Some proteins are involved in structural components of the cell or extracellular matrix, such as COL1A2, which is a part of the collagen family contributing to the structural integrity of various tissues.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Others have roles in the immune response (e.g., FAS, MR1), cell cycle regulation (e.g., PRC1), and apoptosis (e.g., IER3).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Several proteins are associated with specific cellular or physiological systems, such as CATSPER2 in sperm cells and FLT1 in angiogenesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. A number of proteins are involved in post-translational modifications, protein folding, and degradation, such as TRIM14, TRIM69, and USP18, which are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. There are also proteins with more specialized functions, such as PCSK5, which is a proprotein convertase, and ABCA4, which is involved in the visual cycle in photoreceptor cells.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, unifying biological process that these proteins collectively contribute to, it is appropriate to conclude that this is a system of unrelated proteins. The proteins listed do not exhibit a coherent interaction network that would suggest a predominant biological process. Therefore, the confidence score for the process name \"System of unrelated proteins\" is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in the existence of a single, prominent biological process within this group of proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 0.00 | ⋯ | FAS;JAK3                                    | T Cell Homeostasis (GO:0043029)                                                                  | T Cell Homeostasis                                                                   | GO:0043029 | NCKAP1L RIPK3 TNFSF14 PPP2R1A PPP2R3C ZC3H8 FOXP3 PPP2CA LGALS2 FAS AKT1 FADD PMAIP1 JAK3 GPR15LG                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 0.2899676 | 0.02666667 | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

Therefore, the most accurate description for this set of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the absence of a common biological process and the heterogeneity of their functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 0.00 | ⋯ | SCARB2;ATP8A2                               | Aminophospholipid Transport (GO:0015917)                                                         | Aminophospholipid Transport                                                          | GO:0015917 | SCARB2 TMEM30A TMEM30B ATP8A2 ATP8A1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 0.3593996 | 0.04166667 | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

Therefore, the most accurate description of this set of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the absence of a predominant biological process and the diverse nature of their functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 0.00 | ⋯ | CCDC91;AP1G1                                | Golgi To Lysosome Transport (GO:0090160)                                                         | Golgi To Lysosome Transport                                                          | GO:0090160 | AP4M1 EHD3 GAK AP1G1 CCDC91 CLN3 SORT1 LAMP1 ASB15 LAPTM5 RBSN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0.3329341 | 0.03278689 | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

       "1. Transcription factors and regulators like CREB1, YY1, and various zinc finger proteins (e.g., ZNF562, ZNF283, ZNF420) indicate a role in gene expression regulation, but they likely target different sets of genes given their structural diversity and potential for varied DNA-binding specificities.\n",

A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Several proteins such as TSPEAR, SST (somatostatin), PAX6, and METTL3 are involved in distinct cellular processes. For example, TSPEAR is associated with Notch signaling and development, SST is a hormone that inhibits the release of numerous secondary hormones, PAX6 is a key regulatory gene in eye and neural development, and METTL3 is involved in mRNA methylation, impacting RNA stability and translation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Proteins like SETMAR, ZMIZ1, and SMAD7 are implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, respectively. These proteins play roles in maintaining genomic integrity, regulating gene expression, and modulating cell signaling pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Proteins such as GNG3 (a G protein subunit), KIF2C (a kinesin involved in mitosis), and STK3 (a serine/threonine kinase) are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and apoptosis, which are fundamental cellular processes but not indicative of a unified biological process within this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Transport and trafficking proteins like SLC19A2 (a thiamine transporter), MAGOH (involved in mRNA splicing and export), and ABCA6 (a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family) highlight the diversity of functions related to cellular transport mechanisms present in this system.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Proteins such as FERMT1 and ACTR6 are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, respectively, which are critical for cellular structure and motility but do not suggest a common biological process for the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. The presence of non-coding RNA genes like MORC2-AS1 and THAP7-AS1 indicates regulatory roles at the RNA level, adding another layer of functional diversity to the system.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The inclusion of proteins with poorly characterized functions or those represented by locus names (e.g., LOC100131929, C1ORF213) further complicates the identification of a unified biological process.\n",

Several proteins in this system, such as IRF1, IRF7, IRF9, ISG15, and IFI35, are key components of the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. These proteins are involved in the transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which play a crucial role in the innate immune response against viral infections.\n",

       "2. Proteins like OAS1 and RNASEL are part of the antiviral response, where they detect viral RNA and activate pathways that degrade viral nucleic acids, inhibiting viral replication.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. TRIM21, TRIM22, and TRIM38 are members of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein family, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases that facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, including those from invading pathogens.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. TAP1, PSME2, and HLA-F are involved in antigen processing and presentation. TAP1 is part of the transporter associated with antigen processing, which transports peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. PSME2 is a component of the immunoproteasome that processes antigens for presentation, and HLA-F is a non-classical MHC class I molecule that may be involved in immune regulation.\n",

       "5. TNFAIP3 (A20) and GADD45A are involved in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. TNFAIP3 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that negatively regulates NF-kB signaling, while GADD45A is involved in stress-induced apoptosis and DNA repair.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Proteins such as EIF2AK1 and EIF2A are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, particularly under stress conditions such as viral infection. EIF2AK1 phosphorylates EIF2, leading to a reduction in global protein synthesis, which is a host defense mechanism to prevent viral protein translation.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. CMPK2, DNAJB11, PDIA4, and DNAJB9 are involved in various aspects of cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis during viral infections.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Proteins like CXCL10 are chemokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection, while LIFR is involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses.\n",

       "To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the innate immune response, particularly in the context of antiviral defense. They contribute to the detection of viral components, the activation of interferon signaling pathways, the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis, and the processing and presentation of viral antigens. The system reflects a coordinated response to maintain cellular integrity and to initiate adaptive immunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 0.92 | ⋯ | TNFAIP3;SPRY2;ISG15;TRIM21                  | Negative Regulation Of Protein Modification By Small Protein Conjugation Or Removal (GO:1903321) | Negative Regulation Of Protein Modification By Small Protein Conjugation Or Removal  | GO:1903321 | MARCHF6-DT USP4 CAV1 SIRT7 GTPBP4 GNL3L HSPA1A OGT SPOPL COPS9 SQSTM1 HSPA1B IVNS1ABP VPS28 UBXN1 PINX1 RPL11 TNFAIP3 FSCB PARK7 SVBP AKT1 CAPN3 MAGEA2 CHP1 RPS3 N4BP1 PRKCG MINAR1 PRMT3 CAMLG ISG15 KLHL40 SMAD7 PIAS3 DNAJA1 PER2 CRY1 SPRY2 RPL5 NXN CTNNB1 DCUN1D3 ARRB2 U2AF2 SH3RF2 HDAC8 SOX4 BAG5 UFL1 ARRB1 SUMO1 BAG2 TRIM21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 0.2404984 | 0.03278689 | TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

The proteins listed are involved in various cellular activities such as signal transduction, gene regulation, intracellular transport, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. Here is a brief analysis of the diversity of functions represented:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Signal transduction and cellular communication are represented by proteins like FGF19 (a member of the fibroblast growth factor family with roles in bile acid synthesis regulation and metabolic homeostasis), EFNB2 (a member of the ephrin family involved in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system), and GPRC5A (a G protein-coupled receptor with potential roles in cancer development).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like GABPA (a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular growth control), RBM39 (an RNA-binding protein implicated in splicing), and TRIM66 (a tripartite motif-containing protein that may function as a transcriptional regulator).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Intracellular transport and cellular organization are represented by proteins such as KIF18A (a kinesin involved in mitotic spindle assembly), STARD4 (involved in cholesterol trafficking), and CAPZA3 (a capping protein regulating actin filament dynamics).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Metabolic processes are covered by proteins like SLC19A1 (a transporter involved in folate uptake), SCP2 (a sterol carrier protein involved in lipid transfer), and MCCC2 (an enzyme in the leucine degradation pathway).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Cell cycle and DNA damage response are represented by RAD9B (involved in cell cycle checkpoint control) and UCHL1 (a deubiquitinating enzyme with roles in protein degradation).\n",
       "\n",

The lack of a unifying theme or process among these proteins leads to the conclusion that this is a system of unrelated proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 0.00 | ⋯ | OPN1LW;ATRX                                 | Positive Regulation Of Cell Cycle Process (GO:0090068)                                           | Positive Regulation Of Cell Cycle Process                                            | GO:0090068 | GEN1 PDGFRB EGF TAS2R13 SOX15 CDC25B EREG DYNC1LI1 NSFL1C KIF20B PHIP PKP4 RHNO1 MAD2L1 MAP10 OR1A2 UBXN2B CEP120 AURKA NCAPG LRP5 NCAPH AURKC AURKB RACGAP1 CSPP1 E2F7 E2F8 INSR PLK4 NCAPH2 PCID2 STIL XRCC3 PRKCE INO80 IGF1 IGF2 KIF23 ZNF16 NDC80 BTC RGCC PLSCR1 OPN1MW SASS6 BIRC5 RAD18 MAD1L1 OR2A4 NCAPG2 CUL3 NUMA1 CDCA8 CDC14A PDGFB SMC6 SMC4 SMC5 CDC14B RXFP3 SMC2 CDC14C TPR NUP62 CENPV EDN1 RHOA EDN3 MRGPRX2 CDC7 CDC6 SIRT2 SSTR5 OOEP IL1A GIPC1 IL1B INCENP CENPJ RRM2B CD28 GPSM2 KIF14 TGFA RAD21 SPAST OPN1LW CEP295 DRD2 ECT2 MAP3K20 DRD3 NPM2 SVIL RRM1 ATRX RANBP1 DMRT1 SPAG5 DDX11 CIT CDC42 EPGN DBF4 NCAPD2 NCAPD3 PKN2 DYNC1H1 FEN1 WIZ DBF4B CXCR5 INS USP19 NUSAP1 TAS1R2 NUDT16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 0.2442115 | 0.01515152 | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

       "The diversity of these proteins' functions, ranging from structural roles to enzymatic activities and from signal transduction to gene regulation, indicates that they are not collectively dedicated to a singular, well-defined biological process. For example, AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal development, while GCKR (glucokinase regulator) is involved in glucose metabolism. The presence of proteins such as AR (androgen receptor) and CYP19A1 (aromatase, which is involved in steroid metabolism) further illustrates the heterogeneity of the system.\n",

       "Additionally, proteins like BIRC5 (survivin, involved in inhibiting apoptosis and cell cycle regulation), KIF18A (kinesin involved in mitotic spindle assembly), and BBS10 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein, involved in ciliary function) suggest roles in cell division, intracellular transport, and structural maintenance of cilia, respectively.\n",

Therefore, the most accurate description for this collection of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" and the confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in a singular biological process being represented by this system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 0.00 | ⋯ | CCDC88B;HLA-DMA;HLA-DRB4;SIT1               | Regulation Of T Cell Activation (GO:0050863)                                                     | Regulation Of T Cell Activation                                                      | GO:0050863 | CCR2 SPINK5 DUSP3 PRELID1 CRTAM CYRIB LAX1 TNFRSF1B CD2 CD4 KAT2A CD209 GNAO1 HLA-DRA TNFSF9 TNFSF8 HLA-DQB2 VTCN1 FGL1 ILDR2 PTPN22 THY1 SIRPB1 PYCARD FCHO1 ORC3 TBX21 TNFAIP8L2 CTSG B2M HLA-DOB HLA-DQA2 HLA-DOA HLA-DQA1 PAG1 HLA-DRB5 TNFSF18 METTL3 LAPTM5 CCDC88B LCK PRKCQ CD47 HLA-DRB4 HLA-DRB3 HLA-DRB1 SIRPG HSPD1 IL4I1 MYDGF HLA-DMB LGALS3 SIT1 CCL5 GPNMB HLA-DPA1 SIRPA TNFSF11 CCL2 JAK3 HLA-DMA TIGIT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 0.2389413 | 0.03076923 | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |\n",

The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in naming a specific biological process for this diverse group of proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "16  1. Several proteins in this system, such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1), FDFT1 (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1), DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase), DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase), MSMO1 (methylsterol monooxygenase 1), SC5D (sterol-C5-desaturase), and SQLE (squalene epoxidase), are directly involved in the mevalonate pathway, which is the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids.\\n\\n2. INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) and LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) are key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. INSIG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that blocks the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that control the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. LDLR is responsible for the removal of cholesterol from the bloodstream via endocytosis of lipoprotein particles.\\n\\n3. ACLY (ATP citrate lyase) is an enzyme that converts citrate to acetyl-CoA, a precursor for both the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. ELOVL5 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5) and FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) are involved in the elongation and desaturation of fatty acids, respectively, which are critical steps in the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.\\n\\n4. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. SLC27A2 (solute carrier family 27 member 2) is involved in the uptake and activation of long-chain fatty acids.\\n\\n5. Proteins such as IDI1 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1) and FDFT1 are involved in the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are important for various cellular functions including the prenylation of proteins.\\n\\n6. The presence of several cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1B1 (cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1) and CYP51A1 (cytochrome P450 family 51 subfamily A member 1) indicates roles in drug metabolism and the synthesis of sterols, respectively.\\n\\nTo summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of cholesterol and lipids. They participate in the mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and desaturation, and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. The system reflects a coordinated network that ensures the synthesis, uptake, and regulation of lipids and cholesterol, which are vital for membrane structure, energy storage, and signaling molecules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "19  1. Several proteins in this system, such as DDIT4, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, and ATF5, are associated with the cellular stress response. DDIT4 is known to regulate the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. DNAJA1 and HSPA1A are heat shock proteins that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress-induced damage. ATF5 is a transcription factor that is activated under stress to promote cell survival.\\n\\n2. Proteins like ASNS, FASN, G6PD, and SCD are involved in metabolic processes. ASNS is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of asparagine and cellular response to amino acid availability. FASN and SCD are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, while G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate.\\n\\n3. The presence of transcription factors and regulators such as BCL6, FOXO3, MYC, and NFIL3 suggests a role in gene expression control related to metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. BCL6 is a repressor of genes that prevent cell cycle progression and apoptosis. FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. MYC is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and NFIL3 plays a role in circadian rhythm and metabolism.\\n\\n4. Proteins like LDLR and INSIG1 are key components in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR is responsible for the uptake of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the bloodstream, and INSIG1 regulates cholesterol synthesis by controlling the activity of SREBP, a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis.\\n\\n5. The presence of proteins such as AXIN1, BEX1, and SFRP1 indicates involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. AXIN1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, while SFRP1 acts as a soluble modulator that can inhibit Wnt signaling.\\n\\n6. Cell cycle regulation is suggested by proteins like CCNG2, CCNE2, and CDC25A. CCNG2 and CCNE2 are cyclins that regulate the cell cycle progression, whereas CDC25A is a phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and promotes cell cycle progression.\\n\\n7. The system also includes proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival, such as CASP6, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in programmed cell death.\\n\\nTo summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a complex interplay of cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, gene expression control, lipid metabolism, Wnt signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. These processes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The proteins function in a coordinated manner to regulate these processes, often with overlapping roles that contribute to the robustness of cellular responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

It is a key player in the cellular stress response to damaged DNA and is involved in preventing the replication of damaged DNA by activating cell cycle checkpoints.\\n\\n2. PDCD4 (Programmed cell death protein 4) is a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits neoplastic transformation and translation by binding to eIF4A, playing a role in apoptosis and cell survival.\\n\\n3. ZFP36L2 (Zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 2) is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. It binds to adenine-uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs and promotes their degradation, thus playing a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level during stress responses.\\n\\n4. S100A10 (S100 calcium-binding protein A10) is implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. It is also known to play a role in the stress response, particularly in the context of inflammation.\\n\\n5. ADRB2 (Beta-2 adrenergic receptor) is involved in the response to adrenaline and noradrenaline in various tissues. Activation of this receptor leads to a cascade of events involved in the fight-or-flight response and can also modulate the immune response and apoptosis.\\n\\n6.

While they may not directly relate to a single cohesive process, their functions can intersect with cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation.\\n\\nTo summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in a range of processes, but a significant number of them play roles in the cellular response to stress and the regulation of apoptosis. These proteins interact in complex ways to maintain cellular integrity and respond to damage, with implications for cell survival, cell cycle control, and programmed cell death. The confidence score reflects the fact that while many proteins in the system contribute to these processes, not all are directly involved, and the system represents a network with diverse functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Metabolic enzymes such as CYP1B1, DLD, and GMDS participate in various metabolic pathways without a shared primary metabolic process.\\n\\n5. Transcriptional regulation is represented by proteins like PBX1 and SOX11, but they are not part of a cohesive transcriptional network within this system.\\n\\n6. Proteins such as HBB and NTS are related to oxygen transport and neurotransmission, which are distinct physiological processes.\\n\\n7. XIST is involved in X-chromosome inactivation, a process that is not central to the functions of the other proteins in the system.\\n\\nGiven the heterogeneity of the functions and the lack of a central biological process that involves a majority of the proteins, it is appropriate to name this system \"System of unrelated proteins\" and assign a confidence score of 0.00.

       "25  1. Several proteins in this system, such as CD44, VCAN (Versican), and CHI3L1 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1), are known to be involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. VCAN is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. CHI3L1 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in tissue remodeling and is often upregulated in various cancers.\\n\\n2. Proteins like EXT1 (Exostosin-1) and XYLT1 (Xylosyltransferase 1) are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans, respectively. These activities are crucial for the structure and function of the ECM, which is a key component of the tumor microenvironment.\\n\\n3. The presence of proteins such as TNFRSF21 (Death receptor 6) and TNFSF10 (TRAIL) indicates involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways. These proteins can modulate cell death and survival, which are critical processes in cancer progression and response to therapy.\\n\\n4. WNT5A is a member of the Wnt family of proteins that are involved in regulating cell fate and patterning during development. In the context of cancer, WNT5A has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.\\n\\n5. The system includes immune-related proteins such as IGHM, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20, and IGL, which are components of immunoglobulins. These suggest a role in immune surveillance or response within the tumor microenvironment.\\n\\n6. Proteins like TGFBR2 (Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II) and S100A6 are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGFBR2 is a key mediator of TGF-beta signaling, which has complex roles in tumor progression, including tumor suppression in early stages and promotion of invasion and metastasis in later stages.\\n\\n7. The presence of XIST, a long non-coding RNA involved in X chromosome inactivation, suggests a potential role in epigenetic regulation within the system, although its specific role in this context is less clear.\\n\\nIn summary, the proteins in this system are collectively involved in the dynamic modulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly through ECM remodeling, cell adhesion, migration, immune response, and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival. The interplay of these proteins contributes to the structural and functional complexity of the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression and metastasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "271 1. Several proteins in this system, such as CDC45, CCNF, AURKA, ASF1B, FANCI, CCNB1, KIF2C, CEP170, and ERCC6L, are directly involved in cell cycle regulation and progression. CDC45 is a key player in the initiation of DNA replication, while cyclin F (CCNF) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are essential for the regulation of different phases of the cell cycle. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is critical for mitotic spindle assembly, and KIF2C is involved in chromosome segregation.\\n\\n2. Proteins like EXO1, DEPDC1B, and FANCI are associated with DNA repair mechanisms. EXO1 is a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair and recombination, while FANCI is part of the Fanconi anemia pathway, crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. DEPDC1B has been implicated in the regulation of cell division and may have a role in the DNA damage response.\\n\\n3. The presence of proteins such as ERCC6L, a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair, and ASF1B, which is important for chromatin assembly and disassembly during DNA replication and repair, further supports the involvement of this system in DNA damage response and repair.\\n\\n4. The system also includes proteins like TAF12, which is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, playing a role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and thus indirectly influencing cell cycle progression.\\n\\n5. Additionally, proteins such as MYO5A, involved in organelle and vesicle transport, and AQP9, a water channel protein, suggest roles in cellular homeostasis and metabolism that can be critical for cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage.\\n\\nTo summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are functionally interconnected through their roles in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage response. The system appears to be primarily oriented towards ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic integrity, with additional roles in transcription regulation and cellular transport mechanisms that support these primary functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "272 The provided list of proteins encompasses a wide array of functions and does not appear to converge on a single, prominent biological process. The proteins listed are involved in various cellular functions such as ion transport (SLC39A5, SLC5A12), signal transduction (EPHB1, GPR89A, IRS1), gene regulation (HEY2, MEIS2, CHD4), protein synthesis (MRPL47, RPS16P5), cell structure and motility (DPYSL5, SHROOM2), apoptosis (PDCD6), metabolism (FAAH2, RFK), and many others.\\n\\n1. Several proteins like SLC39A5 and SLC5A12 are transporters, indicating roles in ion and nutrient transport, but they do not suggest a unified process.\\n\\n2. Signal transduction is represented by proteins such as EPHB1 and IRS1, which are involved in different signaling pathways and do not point to a single, cohesive biological process.\\n\\n3. Gene regulation is a common theme with proteins like HEY2 and MEIS2, but they regulate diverse sets of genes and are involved in various developmental and cellular processes.\\n\\n4. Proteins involved in protein synthesis, such as MRPL47 and RPS16P5, are essential for general cellular function and do not define a specific biological process within this system.\\n\\n5. Cell structure and motility are influenced by proteins like DPYSL5 and SHROOM2, but again, these proteins are involved in different aspects of cellular architecture and movement.\\n\\n6. Apoptosis and metabolism are represented by proteins such as PDCD6 and FAAH2, respectively, but these proteins are part of broader cellular functions and do not align to a single process.\\n\\nGiven the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear, dominant biological process that these proteins collectively perform, it is appropriate to name this system as a \"System of unrelated proteins\" with a confidence score of 0.00. This reflects the absence of a unifying process that characterizes the majority of the proteins in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "273 1. The proteins IFIH1, STAT2, IRF1, TLR3, CD274, ISG20, IFIT2, and CXCL11 are key components of the innate immune response. IFIH1 (MDA5) and TLR3 are pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNA, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving STAT2 and IRF1, which are transcription factors that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG20 and IFIT2. These ISGs have antiviral functions, and CD274 (PD-L1) is involved in immune checkpoint regulation, which can modulate the immune response.\\n\\n2. Proteins such as CASP10, BCL2L11, and RELA are involved in apoptosis and cell survival pathways. CASP10 is a caspase that plays a role in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while BCL2L11 (BIM) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can initiate apoptosis in response to various stimuli. RELA is a component of the NF-κB complex, which is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and survival.\\n\\n3. Several proteins, including ADAMTS18, GOLGA8I, and PER1, are associated with various cellular processes. ADAMTS18 is a metalloproteinase that may be involved in the extracellular matrix organization, GOLGA8I is part of the golgin family and may play a role in Golgi apparatus structure and function, and PER1 is a core clock protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.\\n\\n4. Proteins such as SLC34A1, SLC15A3, and SLC23A2 are transporters that facilitate the movement of specific substrates across cellular membranes. SLC34A1 is a phosphate transporter, SLC15A3 is a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, and SLC23A2 is a vitamin C transporter.\\n\\n5. The presence of proteins like IDH3A, LDHB, and GYS1 indicates involvement in metabolic processes. IDH3A is a subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase involved in the TCA cycle, LDHB is involved in lactate metabolism, and GYS1 is glycogen synthase, which plays a role in glycogen biosynthesis.\\n\\n6. Proteins such as OPTN, CEACAM1, and PLAUR are implicated in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions. OPTN is involved in autophagy and NF-κB signaling, CEACAM1 participates in cell adhesion and signaling, and PLAUR (uPAR) is involved in cell migration and tissue remodeling.\\n\\nTo summarize, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins are related to the innate immune response, particularly the antiviral response, and the regulation of apoptosis. These processes are critical for the immediate defense against pathogens and the control of cell fate in response to stress or damage. The proteins involved in these processes are functionally integrated, with several acting synergistically to amplify the immune response or regulate apoptosis. However, the system also includes proteins with diverse functions not directly related to these processes, which is reflected in the confidence score.\\n\\nGiven the complexity and diversity of the protein functions, the confidence score is not at the maximum, as not all proteins are directly involved in the identified processes. However, the prominence of the innate immune response and apoptosis regulation components justifies a relatively high confidence score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "276 1. WDR16, or WD repeat domain 16, is a protein that is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and may play a role in autophagy. The specific functions of WDR16 are not well-characterized, but given its domain structure, it is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions that facilitate signal transduction pathways or assembly of protein complexes.\\n\\n2. GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to internal signaling pathways. The gamma subunit, along with the beta subunit, forms a complex that interacts with the alpha subunit and receptors. GNG12 is implicated in the modulation of various signaling cascades, including those that regulate cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and possibly angiogenesis.\\n\\n3. NSMAF, also known as neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activation associated factor, is involved in the ceramide signaling pathway. Ceramide is a lipid molecule that acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling cascades, particularly those related to stress responses, inflammation, and apoptosis. NSMAF is thought to be involved in the activation of N-SMase, which leads to the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin.\\n\\nTo summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling. WDR16 may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes or pathways, GNG12 is directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and NSMAF is associated with lipid signaling pathways. While the specific interactions between these proteins are not well-defined, their collective involvement in signaling suggests a role in modulating intracellular communication and response to external stimuli. The confidence score reflects the fact that while each protein is involved in signaling, the direct connections and integration of their functions within a single, prominent biological process are not fully established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "278 The provided list of proteins encompasses a wide array of biological functions and processes, which do not appear to converge on a single, prominent biological process. A critical analysis of the proteins listed reveals the following:\\n\\n1. The proteins span multiple cellular compartments and systems, including transcription factors (FOXM1, HNF4G, SP2), enzymes (LDHA, ACHE, FN3K), structural proteins (KRT39), and receptors (CXCR4, OR7A5).\\n\\n2. Some proteins are involved in signal transduction and immune responses (CXCR4, IL6, CCL2), while others are implicated in metabolic processes (LDHA, ACHE, GYG1).\\n\\n3. Several proteins have roles in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (CDC7, WEE1, FOXM1), whereas others are involved in neuronal development and function (NELL2, PDYN, PCP4L1).\\n\\n4. A few proteins are associated with specific diseases or conditions, such as NPC2 with Niemann-Pick disease and G6PC3 with severe congenital neutropenia.\\n\\n5. There are proteins that are less characterized or have unknown functions (LOC100128002, KIAA1377), which further complicates the identification of a common biological process.\\n\\n6. The list includes proteins that are part of the ribosomal machinery (RPL22, RPL38) and protein synthesis (EIF3E, NAA10), but these do not represent a majority of the system.\\n\\nGiven the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear majority of proteins participating in a single, coherent biological process, it is appropriate to conclude that this system does not revolve around a central biological theme. Therefore, the most accurate description for this group of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" reflecting the absence of a unifying biological process.

MCM8 is part of the minichromosome maintenance complex necessary for the initiation of DNA replication. RPA1 is involved in DNA replication and repair, while POLR3D is a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which synthesizes small RNAs and is involved in cell growth and maintenance.\\n\\n2. Proteins like NFKB2, PPP1R15A, and HES1 are key components in stress response and signaling pathways. NFKB2 is part of the NF-kappa-B family of transcription factors that play a crucial role in inflammation and immune responses. PPP1R15A, also known as GADD34, is involved in the stress-induced regulation of protein synthesis. HES1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is implicated in cell differentiation and proliferation.\\n\\n3. Proteins such as RAC1, CCT3, and RNF115 are involved in cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking, and protein ubiquitination, respectively. RAC1 is a small GTPase that regulates the formation of actin cytoskeleton. CCT3 is a chaperonin involved in the proper folding of actin and tubulin. RNF115 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of proteins, targeting them for degradation.\\n\\n4. Proteins like CDV3, CBR3-AS1, and MET are involved in various cellular processes. CDV3 is associated with vesicle-mediated transport, CBR3-AS1 is a non-coding RNA that may regulate gene expression, and MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, motility, and differentiation.\\n\\n5.

These proteins are components of the ribosome and are essential for the translation of mRNA into proteins.\\n\\n6. Proteins like LPAR3 and FLCN are involved in cell signaling and nutrient sensing. LPAR3 is a G-protein coupled receptor for lysophosphatidic acid, which mediates cell proliferation and survival. FLCN is a tumor suppressor that may be involved in energy and nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways.\\n\\nTo summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, with a significant number participating in cell proliferation, DNA replication, stress response, and protein synthesis. The interplay between these proteins suggests a complex network that regulates cell growth and responds to cellular stress.

The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating the lowest confidence in assigning a specific biological process to this system of interacting proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

For example, AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal development, while GCKR (glucokinase regulator) is involved in glucose metabolism. The presence of proteins such as AR (androgen receptor) and CYP19A1 (aromatase, which is involved in steroid metabolism) further illustrates the heterogeneity of the system.\\n\\nAdditionally, proteins like BIRC5 (survivin, involved in inhibiting apoptosis and cell cycle regulation), KIF18A (kinesin involved in mitotic spindle assembly), and BBS10 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein, involved in ciliary function) suggest roles in cell division, intracellular transport, and structural maintenance of cilia, respectively.\\n\\nGiven the broad spectrum of unrelated functions and the lack of a unifying theme or pathway among these proteins, it is appropriate to conclude that this system does not represent a coherent biological process. Therefore, the most accurate description for this collection of proteins is a \"System of unrelated proteins,\" and the confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that there is no confidence in a singular biological process being represented by this system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
