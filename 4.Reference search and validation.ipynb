      "Targeting defects in metabolism is an underutilized strategy for the treatment of cancer. Arginine auxotrophy resulting from the silencing of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) is a common metabolic alteration reported in a broad range of aggressive cancers. To assess the metabolic effects that arise from acute and chronic arginine starvation in ASS1-deficient cell lines, we performed metabolite profiling. We found that pharmacologically induced arginine depletion causes increased serine biosynthesis, glutamine anaplerosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and decreased aerobic glycolysis, effectively inhibiting the Warburg effect. The reduction of glycolysis in cells otherwise dependent on aerobic glycolysis is correlated with reduced PKM2 expression and phosphorylation and upregulation of PHGDH. Concurrent arginine deprivation and glutaminase inhibition was found to be synthetic lethal across a spectrum of ASS1-deficient tumor cell lines and is sufficient to cause in vivo tumor regression in mice. These results identify two synthetic lethal therapeutic strategies exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities of ASS1-negative cancers.\n",

      "The risk stratification and final outcomes in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) still remain suboptimal. Our principal goals were to identify and validate targetable metabolic drivers relevant to pathogenesis of NPC using a published transcriptome. One prominently downregulated gene regulating amino acid metabolism was found to be argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1). Attributable to epigenetic DNA methylation, ASS1 deficiency may link to the therapeutic sensitivity to the arginine-depriving agents and promote tumor aggressiveness through its newly identified tumor suppressor function. ASS1 immunohistochemistry was therefore examined in a well-defined cohort of 124 NPC biopsy specimens and in the neck lymph node metastases of another ten independent cases. For the latter, bisulphite pyrosequencing was performed to evaluate the extent of ASS1 gene methylation. ASS1 protein deficiency was identified in 64 of 124 cases (51.6%), significantly related to T3-T4 status (p = 0.006), and univariately associated with inferior local recurrence-free survival (p = 0.0427), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; p = 0.0036), and disease-specific survival (DSS; p = 0.0069). Together with advanced AJCC stages III-IV, ASS1 protein deficiency was also independently predictive of worse outcomes for the DFMS (p = 0.010, hazard ratio = 2.241) and DSS (p = 0.020, hazard ratio = 1.900). ASS1 promoter hypermethylation was detected in eight of ten neck nodal metastatic lesions by bisulphite pyrosequencing and associated with ASS1 protein deficiency (p < 0.001). In summary, ASS1 protein deficiency was seen in approximately a half of NPCs and associated with advanced T classification, DNA methylation, and clinical aggressiveness, consistent with its tumor suppressor role. This aberration may render pegylated arginine deiminase as a promising strategy for ASS1-deficient NPCs.\n",

      "Alterations in DNA methylation are important epigenetic markers in bladder cancer (BC). These epigenome modifications may drive the mechanisms of aggressive chemo-resistant BC. Clinicopathological biomarkers that indicate chemotherapeutic resistance are critical for better assessing treatment strategies for individual patients. Thus, in this study, we aimed to determine whether DNA methylation of certain metabolic enzymes is significantly altered in cisplatin-resistant BC cells. <b>Methods:</b> To characterize CpG methylation and nucleosome accessibility in cisplatin-resistant BC cells, the Illumina Infinium HM450 DNA methylation assay was performed. Perturbed gene expression was found to be associated with cisplatin resistance, and the biological roles of spermidine/spermine N<sup>1</sup>-acetyltransferase (SAT1) and argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) were further studied using qRT-PCR analysis and various cell biology assays, including western blot. <b>Results:</b><i>ASS1</i> and <i>SAT1</i>, genes for amino acid and polyamine metabolism catalysts, respectively, were found to be vastly hypermethylated, resulting in greatly downregulated expression. ASS1 expression is of particular interest because prior studies have demonstrated its potential association with BC stage and recurrence. In regard to chemoresistance, we found that aberrant expression or induced stimulation of SAT1 restored cisplatin sensitivity in the cell culture system. We also found that the addition of exogenous arginine deiminase through administration of ADI-PEG 20 (pegylated arginine deiminase) increased ASS1 expression and enhanced cisplatin's apoptotic effects. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study demonstrates a novel mechanistic link between the epigenetic perturbation of SAT1 and ASS1 and cancer metabolism in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells. These findings suggest potential utility of <i>SAT1</i> and <i>ASS1</i> as predictive biomarkers in re-sensitizing bladder cancer to chemotherapy and personalizing therapy.\n",

      "Non-enzymatic chitinase-3 like-protein-1 (CHI3L1) belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 18. It binds to chitin, heparin, and hyaluronic acid, and is regulated by extracellular matrix changes, cytokines, growth factors, drugs, and stress. CHI3L1 is synthesized and secreted by a multitude of cells including macrophages, neutrophils, synoviocytes, chondrocytes, fibroblast-like cells, smooth muscle cells, and tumor cells. It plays a major role in tissue injury, inflammation, tissue repair, and remodeling responses. CHI3L1 has been strongly associated with diseases including asthma, arthritis, sepsis, diabetes, liver fibrosis, and coronary artery disease. Moreover, following its initial identification in the culture supernatant of the MG63 osteosarcoma cell line, CHI3L1 has been shown to be overexpressed in a wealth of both human cancers and animal tumor models. To date, interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-2, transmembrane protein 219, galectin-3, chemo-attractant receptor-homologous 2, and CD44 have been identified as CHI3L1 receptors. CHI3L1 signaling plays a critical role in cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, activation of tumor-associated macrophages, and Th2 polarization of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Interestingly, CHI3L1-based targeted therapy has been increasingly applied to the treatment of tumors including glioma and colon cancer as well as rheumatoid arthritis. This review summarizes the potential roles and mechanisms of CHI3L1 in oncogenesis and disease pathogenesis, then posits investigational strategies for targeted therapies.\n",

      "Galectin-3 (Gal-3) regulates basic cellular functions such as cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, growth, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. It is not surprising, therefore, that this protein is involved in the pathogenesis of many relevant human diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, chronic inflammation and scarring affecting many different tissues. The papers published in the literature have progressively increased in number during the last decades, testifying the great interest given to this protein by numerous researchers involved in many different clinical contexts. Considering the crucial role exerted by Gal-3 in many different clinical conditions, Gal-3 is emerging as a new diagnostic, prognostic biomarker and as a new promising therapeutic target. The current review aims to extensively examine the studies published so far on the role of Gal-3 in all the clinical conditions and diseases, listed in alphabetical order, where it was analyzed.\n",

      "INTRODUCTIONAcute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common in hospitalized patients. To inform clinical decision making, more accurate information regarding risk of long-term progression to kidney failure is required.METHODSWe enrolled 1538 hospitalized patients in a multicenter, prospective cohort study. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2), uromodulin (UMOD), and YKL-40 (CHI3L1) were measured in urine samples collected during outpatient follow-up at 3 months. We followed patients for a median of 4.3 years and assessed the relationship between biomarker levels and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time and the development of a composite kidney outcome (CKD incidence, CKD progression, or end-stage renal disease). We paired these clinical studies with investigations in mouse models of renal atrophy and renal repair to further understand the molecular basis of these markers in kidney disease progression.RESULTSHigher MCP-1 and YKL-40 levels were associated with greater eGFR decline and increased incidence of the composite renal outcome, whereas higher UMOD levels were associated with smaller eGFR declines and decreased incidence of the composite kidney outcome. A multimarker score increased prognostic accuracy and reclassification compared with traditional clinical variables alone. The mouse model of renal atrophy showed greater Ccl2 and Chi3l1 mRNA expression in infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils, respectively, and evidence of progressive renal fibrosis compared with the repair model. The repair model showed greater Umod expression in the loop of Henle and correspondingly less fibrosis.CONCLUSIONSBiomarker levels at 3 months after hospitalization identify patients at risk for kidney disease progression.FUNDINGNIH.\n",

These figures are expected to increase to 693 million by 2045; thus, innovative preventative programs and treatments are a necessity to fight this escalating pandemic disorder. Caveolin-1 (CAV1), an integral membrane protein, is the principal component of caveolae in membranes and is involved in multiple cellular functions such as endocytosis, cholesterol homeostasis, signal transduction, and mechanoprotection. Previous studies demonstrated that CAV1 is critical for insulin receptor-mediated signaling, insulin secretion, and potentially the development of insulin resistance.

      "Caveolin-1 (CAV1), the structural protein of caveolae in the plasma membrane, has emerged as a regulator of liver function. CAV1 modulates several molecular pathways leading to the regulation of hepatic lipid accumulation, lipid and glucose metabolism, mitochondrial biology, and hepatocyte proliferation. CAV1 thus plays a crucial role in maintaining hepatic physiology during metabolic adaptation to fasting, liver steatosis, and hepatocyte proliferation associated with liver regeneration. With failure of such processes, CAV1 has been implicated in the modulation of cholestasis, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinogenesis. This review discusses the latest research in CAV1 biology and related proteins, aiming to guide future endeavors that explore their role in liver physiology and disease.\n",

      "Despite their emerging relevance to fully understand disease pathogenesis, we have as yet a poor understanding as to how biomechanical signals are integrated with specific biochemical pathways to determine cell behaviour. Mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) markers colocalized with TGF-β1-dependent signaling and yes-associated protein (YAP) activation across biopsies from different pathologies exhibiting peritoneal fibrosis, supporting mechanotransduction as a central driving component of these class of fibrotic lesions and its crosstalk with specific signaling pathways. Transcriptome and proteome profiling of the response of mesothelial cells (MCs) to linear cyclic stretch revealed molecular changes compatible with bona fide MMT, which (i) overlapped with established YAP target gene subsets, and were largely dependent on endogenous TGF-β1 signaling. Importantly, TGF-β1 blockade blunts the transcriptional upregulation of these gene signatures, but not the mechanical activation and nuclear translocation of YAP per se. We studied the role therein of caveolin-1 (CAV1), a plasma membrane mechanotransducer. Exposure of CAV1-deficient MCs to cyclic stretch led to a robust upregulation of MMT-related gene programs, which was blunted upon TGF-β1 inhibition. Conversely, CAV1 depletion enhanced both TGF-β1 and TGFBRI expression, whereas its re-expression blunted mechanical stretching-induced MMT. CAV1 genetic deficiency exacerbated MMT and adhesion formation in an experimental murine model of peritoneal ischaemic buttons. Taken together, these results support that CAV1-YAP/TAZ fine-tune the fibrotic response through the modulation of MMT, onto which TGF-β1-dependent signaling coordinately converges. Our findings reveal a cooperation between biomechanical and biochemical signals in the triggering of MMT, representing a novel potential opportunity to intervene mechanically induced disorders coursing with peritoneal fibrosis, such as post-surgical adhesions.\n",

      "Gastric cancer is an important health problem, being the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Aberrant protein translation contributes to the oncogenesis and development of cancers, and upregulation of translation initiation factor eIF4A1 has been observed in several kinds of malignancies. However, the role of eIF4A1 in gastric cancer progression remains unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of eIF4A1, a component of translation initiation complex, was increased in gastric cancer. High expression of eIF4A1 was positively associated with poor tumor differentiation, late T stage, lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. Overexpression of eIF4A1 promoted the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro and enhanced tumor metastasis in nude mice model. Mechanism studies revealed that eIF4A1 induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of gastric cancer cells through driving the translation of SNAI1 mRNA. Together, these findings indicate that eIF4A1 promotes EMT and metastasis of gastric cancer and suggest that eIF4A1 is a potential target for the adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer patients.\n",

      "Regulation of signal transduction pathways is crucial for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and organismal development in fungi. Transcription factors are key elements of this regulatory network. The basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain of the bZIP-type transcription factors is responsible for DNA binding while their leucine zipper structural motifs are suitable for dimerization with each other facilitiating the formation of homodimeric or heterodimeric bZIP proteins. This review highlights recent knowledge on the function of fungal orthologs of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Atf1, Aspergillus nidulans AtfA, and Fusarium verticillioides FvAtfA, bZIP-type transcription factors with a special focus on pathogenic species. We demonstrate that fungal Atf1-AtfA-FvAtfA orthologs play an important role in vegetative growth, sexual and asexual development, stress response, secondary metabolite production, and virulence both in human pathogens, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Mucor circinelloides, Penicillium marneffei, and Cryptococcus neoformans and plant pathogens, like Fusarium ssp., Magnaporthe oryzae, Claviceps purpurea, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. KEY POINTS: • Atf1 orthologs play crucial role in the growth and development of fungi. • Atf1 orthologs orchestrate environmental stress response of fungi. • Secondary metabolite production and virulence are coordinated by Atf1 orthologs.\n",

      "Small molecules and antisense oligonucleotides that inhibit the translation initiation factors eIF4A1 and eIF4E have been explored as broad-based therapeutic agents for cancer treatment, based on the frequent upregulation of these two subunits of the eIF4F cap-binding complex in many cancer cells. Here, we provide support for these therapeutic approaches with mechanistic studies of eIF4F-driven tumor progression in a preclinical model of melanoma. Silencing eIF4A1 or eIF4E decreases melanoma proliferation and invasion. There were common effects on the level of cell-cycle proteins that could explain the antiproliferative effects in vitro Using clinical specimens, we correlate the common cell-cycle targets of eIF4A1 and eIF4E with patient survival. Finally, comparative proteomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal extensive mechanistic divergence in response to eIF4A1 or eIF4E silencing. Current models indicate that eIF4A1 and eIF4E function together through the 5'UTR to increase translation of oncogenes. In contrast, our data demonstrate that the common effects of eIF4A1 and eIF4E on translation are mediated by the coding region and 3'UTR. Moreover, their divergent effects occur through the 5'UTR. Overall, our work shows that it will be important to evaluate subunit-specific inhibitors of eIF4F in different disease contexts to fully understand their anticancer actions.

      "Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.\n",

      "Primary immunodeficiencies are inherited disorders of the immune system, often caused by the mutation of genes required for lymphocyte development and activation. Recently, several studies have identified gain-of-function mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) genes PIK3CD (which encodes p110δ) and PIK3R1 (which encodes p85α) that cause a combined immunodeficiency syndrome, referred to as activated PI3Kδ syndrome (APDS; also known as p110δ-activating mutation causing senescent T cells, lymphadenopathy and immunodeficiency (PASLI)). Paradoxically, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations that affect these genes lead to immunosuppression, albeit via different mechanisms. Here, we review the roles of PI3Kδ in adaptive immunity, describe the clinical manifestations and mechanisms of disease in APDS and highlight new insights into PI3Kδ gleaned from these patients, as well as implications of these findings for clinical therapy.\n",

      "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is involved in a broad range of cellular processes, including growth, metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, motility, and survival. The PI3Kδ enzyme complex is primarily present in the immune system and comprises a catalytic (p110δ) and regulatory (p85α) subunit. Dynamic regulation of PI3Kδ activity is required to ensure normal function and differentiation of immune cells. In the last decade, discovery of germline mutations in genes involved in the PI3Kδ pathway (PIK3CD, PIK3R1, or phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN]) proved that both overactivation and underactivation (gain of function and loss of function, respectively) of PI3Kδ lead to impaired and dysregulated immunity. Although a small group of patients reported to underactivate PI3Kδ show predominantly humoral defects and autoimmune features, more than 200 patients have been described with overactivation of PI3Kδ, presenting with a much more complex phenotype of combined immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation. The clinical and immunologic characterization, as well as current pathophysiologic understanding and specific therapies for PI3K pathway defects leading to immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation, are reviewed here.\n",

      "Misregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes has been linked to a wide variety of cancer types. Here we report on Mammary Tumor Associated RNA 25 (MaTAR25), a nuclear enriched and chromatin associated lncRNA that plays a role in mammary tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. MaTAR25 functions by interacting with purine rich element binding protein B (PURB), and associating with a major downstream target gene Tensin1 (Tns1) to regulate its expression in trans. The Tns1 protein product is a critical component of focal adhesions linking signaling between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton. Knockout of MaTAR25 results in down-regulation of Tns1 leading to a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and a reduction of focal adhesions and microvilli. We identify LINC01271 as the human ortholog of MaTAR25, and importantly, increased expression of LINC01271 is associated with poor patient prognosis and metastasis. Our findings demonstrate that LINC01271 represents a potential therapeutic target to alter breast cancer progression.\n",

      "The extracellular matrix (ECM) initiates mechanical cues that activate intracellular signaling through matrix-cell interactions. In blood vessels, additional mechanical cues derived from the pulsatile blood flow and pressure play a pivotal role in homeostasis and disease development. Currently, the nature of the cues from the ECM and their interaction with the mechanical microenvironment in large blood vessels to maintain the integrity of the vessel wall are not fully understood. Here, we identified the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1) as an extracellular mediator of matrix mechanotransduction that acts via integrin αvβ1 to establish focal adhesions and promotes nuclear shuttling of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in response to high strain of cyclic stretch. Thbs1-mediated YAP activation depends on the small GTPase Rap2 and Hippo pathway and is not influenced by alteration of actin fibers. Deletion of <i>Thbs1</i> in mice inhibited Thbs1/integrin β1/YAP signaling, leading to maladaptive remodeling of the aorta in response to pressure overload and inhibition of neointima formation upon carotid artery ligation, exerting context-dependent effects on the vessel wall. We thus propose a mechanism of matrix mechanotransduction centered on Thbs1, connecting mechanical stimuli to YAP signaling during vascular remodeling in vivo.\n",

      "The identification of thrombospondin-1 as an angiogenesis inhibitor in 1990 prompted interest in its role in cancer biology and potential as a therapeutic target. Decreased thrombospondin-1 mRNA and protein expression are associated with progression in several cancers, while expression by nonmalignant cells in the tumor microenvironment and circulating levels in cancer patients can be elevated. <i>THBS1</i> is not a tumor suppressor gene, but the regulation of its expression in malignant cells by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes mediates some of their effects on carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. In addition to regulating angiogenesis and perfusion of the tumor vasculature, thrombospondin-1 limits antitumor immunity by CD47-dependent regulation of innate and adaptive immune cells. Conversely, thrombospondin-1 is a component of particles released by immune cells that mediate tumor cell killing. Thrombospondin-1 differentially regulates the sensitivity of malignant and nonmalignant cells to genotoxic stress caused by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The diverse activities of thrombospondin-1 to regulate autophagy, senescence, stem cell maintenance, extracellular vesicle function, and metabolic responses to ischemic and genotoxic stress are mediated by several cell surface receptors and by regulating the functions of several secreted proteins. This review highlights progress in understanding thrombospondin-1 functions in cancer and the challenges that remain in harnessing its therapeutic potential.\n",

      "Epidermal keratinocytes serve as the primary barrier between the body and environmental stressors. They are subjected to numerous stress events and are likely to respond with a repertoire of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPA6 (HSP70B') is described in other cell types with characteristically low to undetectable basal expression, but is highly stress induced. Despite this response in other cells, little is known about its control in keratinocytes. We examined endogenous human keratinocyte HSPA6 expression and localized some responsible transcription factor sites in a cloned HSPA6 3 kb promoter. Using promoter 5' truncations and deletions, negative and positive regulatory regions were found throughout the 3 kb promoter. A region between -346 and -217 bp was found to be crucial to HSPA6 basal expression and stress inducibility. Site-specific mutations and DNA-binding studies show that a previously uncharacterized AP1 site contributes to the basal expression and maximal stress induction of HSPA6. Additionally, a new heat shock element (HSE) within this region was defined. While this element mediates increased transcriptional response in thermally stressed HaCaT keratinocytes, it preferentially binds a stress-inducible factor other than heat shock factor (HSF)1 or HSF2. Intriguingly, this newly characterized HSPA6 HSE competes HSF1 binding a consensus HSE and binds both HSF1 and HSF2 from other epithelial cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the HSPA6 promoter contains essential negative and positive promoter regions and newly identified transcription factor targets, which are key to the basal and stress-inducible expression of HSPA6. Furthermore, these results suggest that an HSF-like factor may preferentially bind this newly identified HSPA6 HSE in HaCaT cells.\n",

      "Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a set of highly conserved proteins that are involved in cellular repair and protective mechanisms. In order to identify potential stress-sensitive sites in differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells, localization of two inducible members of the HSPA (HSP70) family was investigated, namely HSPA6 (HSP70B') and HSPA1A (HSP70-1). Following heat shock, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged HSPA6 and HSPA1A proteins localized to nuclear speckles that are enriched in RNA splicing factors (identified by SC35 and SON marker proteins) and then to the granular component of the nucleolus (identified by nucleophosmin). Subsequently, YFP-HSPA6 protein, but not YFP-HSPA1A, localized to the periphery of nuclear speckles that are sites of RNA transcription. The HSPA6 gene is present in the human genome but not in genomes of rat and mouse. Hence, current animal models of neurodegenerative diseases are lacking a potentially protective member of the HSPA family. Potential stress-sensitive sites were identified in differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells by the localization of HSPA6 (HSP70B') and HSPA1A (HSP70-1) to nuclear components following heat shock. HSPA6 and HSPA1A rapidly moved to nuclear speckles, enriched in RNA splicing factors, then to the granular layer of the nucleolus. Subsequently, HSPA6 exhibited a novel localization not observed for the more widely studied HSPA1A, namely association with the periphery of nuclear speckles that are sites of transcription. HS = heat shock; HSPA6 = HSP70B' protein; HSPA1A = HSP70-1 protein.\n",

The HSPA (Hsp70) multigene family includes the widely studied HSPA1A (Hsp70-1) and the little studied HSPA6 (Hsp70B') which is present in the human genome and not in mouse and rat. The effect of knockdown of HSPA6 and HSPA1A expression was examined in relation to the ability of differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells to tolerate thermal stress. Low dose co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol, which induces Hsps, enhanced the ability of differentiated neurons to survive heat shock. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of HSPA6 and HSPA1A resulted in loss of the protective effect of co-application of celastrol/arimoclomol. More pronounced effects on neuronal viability were apparent at 44 °C heat shock compared to 43 °C. siRNA knockdown suggests that HSPA6 and HSPA1A contribute to protection of differentiated human neuronal cells from cellular stress.\n",

      "Nuclear Factor Kappa-Β (NF-kB) is recognized as one of the main inflammatory pathways in the Autoimmune Disease (AD) Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which exhibits high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNFa and IL-6 linked to bone erosion and disease progression. NF-kB is also the most studied pathophysiological mechanism in RA, however, over the last few decades, a more recently discovered Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-Β Ligand (RANKL), also linked to NF-kB activation and bone erosion, has been the topic of interest for research in the area of AD management. As the non-discriminative long term suppression of the NF-kB pathway by pharmacological agents in the management of RA has been linked with a number of side effects and with the discovery of the RANKL mechanism, which may present a more targeted approach to the management of the AD, there has been renewed interest in research on the potential impact of nutritional interventions influencing the NF-kB pathway, RANKL as well as RA disease outcomes. Existing research highlights the potential utility of nutrients such as Omega 3 and Vitamin D, which may lower NF-kB activation in RA. There is, however, a gap in the knowledge of the effects of nutritional interventions on pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to RA and a more robust systematic analysis of whether nutrients or specific vitamins can have an effect on the NF-kB and RANKL main drivers of pathology in RA. Findings from this study suggest the potential of Vitamin D supplementation in lowering the levels of RANKL and related markers/cytokines such as Th17 cell levels, OPG/RANKL ratio and CXCL10 pathway, which may present as a viable nutrition intervention for the management of RA. The methodology of this review involved a Systematic Search of the Literature with a Critical Appraisal of papers. It incorporated three tranche searches of 1. review, 2. animal/in vitro and 3. intervention peer reviewed research published in the last 10 years, resulting in a total of 119 papers. Results provide an overview of the NF-kB pathway, a detailed mechanistic examination of the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-Β Ligand (RANKL) which is linked to bone erosion, and finally a review of nutritional interventions relating to this mechanism of pathophysiology. The accepted papers were critically appraised using SIGN50 for human studies and the ARRIVE guidelines for animal studies; the narrative was and the extracted information coded into key themes.\n",

      "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) has long been known for its pleiotropic effects on inflammation that plays a complex, and sometimes contrasting, role in different stages of cancer development. As a major proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β is mainly expressed by innate immune cells. IL-1α, however, is expressed by various cell types under physiological and pathological conditions. IL-1R1 is the main receptor for both ligands and is expressed by various cell types, including innate and adaptive immune cell types, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, adipocytes, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, etc. IL-1 and IL-1R1 receptor interaction leads to a set of common signaling pathways, mainly the NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways, as a result of complex positive and negative regulations. The variety of cell types with IL-1R1 expression dictates the role of IL-1 signaling at different stages of cancer, which under certain circumstances leads to contrasting roles in tumor development. Recent availability of IL-1R1 conditional knockout mouse model has made it possible to dissect the role of IL-1/IL-1R1 signaling transduction in different cell types within the tumor microenvironment. This chapter will focus on the role of IL-1/IL-1R1 in different cell types within the tumor microenvironment and discuss the potential of targeting this pathway in cancer therapy.\n",

      "Ageing can be defined as the progressive failure of repair and maintenance systems with a consequent accumulation of cellular damage in nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. These various types of damage promote ageing by driving cellular senescence and apoptosis. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway is one of the key mediators of ageing and this pathway is activated by genotoxic, oxidative and inflammatory stress, and regulates expression of cytokines, growth factors, and genes that regulate apoptosis, cell-cycle progression, and inflammation. Therefore, NF-kB is increased in a variety of tissues with ageing, thus the inhibition of NF-kB leads to delayed onset of ageing-related symptoms and pathologies such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Metformin is often used as an anti-diabetic medication in type 2 diabetes throughout the world and appears to be a potential anti-ageing agent. Owing to its antioxidant, anticancer, cardio-protective and anti-inflammatory properties, metformin has become a potential candidate drug, improving in the context of ageing and ageing-related diseases. An inappropriate NF-kB activation is associated with diseases and pathologic conditions which can impair the activity of genes involved in cell senescence, apoptosis, immunity, and inflammation. Metformin, inhibiting the expression of NF-kB gene, eliminates the susceptibility to common diseases. This review underlines the pleiotropic effects of metformin in ageing and different ageing-related diseases and attributes its effects to the modulation of NF-kB.\n",

      "Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the most prominent lysoglycerophospholipids, are emerging as a novel class of inflammatory lipids, joining thromboxanes, leukotrienes and prostaglandins with which they share metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms. Enzymes that participate in LPC and LPA metabolism, such as the phospholipase A(2) superfamily (PLA(2)) and autotaxin (ATX, ENPP2), play central roles in regulating LPC and LPA levels and consequently their actions. LPC/LPA biosynthetic pathways will be briefly presented and LPC/LPA signaling properties and their possible functions in the regulation of the immune system and chronic inflammation will be reviewed. Furthermore, implications of exacerbated LPC and/or LPA signaling in the context of chronic inflammatory diseases, namely rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis and hepatitis, will be discussed.

      "Body weight is tightly regulated by food intake and energy dissipation, and obesity is related to decreased energy expenditure (EE). Herein, we show that nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2, autotaxin) is an adipose-derived, secreted enzyme that controls adipose expansion, brown adipose tissue (BAT) function, and EE. In mice, Enpp2 was highly expressed in visceral white adipose tissue and BAT and is downregulated in hypertrophied adipocytes/adipose tissue. Enpp2(+/-) mice and adipocyte-specific Enpp2 knockout mice fed a high-fat diet showed smaller body weight gains and less insulin resistance than control mice fed the same diet. BAT was functionally more active and EE was increased in Enpp2-deficient mice. In humans, ENPP2 expression in subcutaneous fat and ENPP2 levels in serum were reduced in obese subjects. Taken together, our results establish ENPP2 as an adipose-derived, secreted enzyme that regulates adipose obesity and systemic metabolism. They also suggest ENPP2 could be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disease.\n",

      "Pathogenesis and progression of lung cancer are governed by complex interactions between the environment and host genetic susceptibility, which is further modulated by genetic and epigenetic changes. Autotaxin (ATX, ENPP2) is a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the extracellular production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a growth-factor-like phospholipid that is further regulated by phospholipid phosphatases (PLPP). LPA's pleiotropic effects in almost all cell types are mediated through at least six G-protein coupled LPA receptors (LPAR) that exhibit overlapping specificities, widespread distribution, and differential expression profiles. Here we use both preclinical models of lung cancer and clinical samples (from patients and healthy controls) to investigate the expression levels, activity, and biological role of the above components of the ATX/LPA axis in lung cancer. <i>ENPP2</i> was genetically altered in 8% of patients with lung cancer, whereas increased ATX staining and activity were detected in patient biopsies and sera, respectively. Moreover, <i>PLPP3</i> expression was consistently downregulated in patients with lung cancer. Comparable observations were made in the two most widely used animal models of lung cancer, the carcinogen urethane-induced and the genetically engineered <i>K-ras</i><sup><i>G12D</i></sup> -driven models, where genetic deletion of <i>Enpp2</i> or <i>Lpar1</i> resulted in disease attenuation, thus confirming a procarcinogenic role of LPA signaling in the lung. Expression profiling data analysis suggested that metabolic rewiring may be implicated in the procarcinogenic effects of the ATX/LPA axis in <i>K-ras</i>- <sup><i>G12D</i></sup> -driven lung cancer pathogenesis.<b>Significance:</b> These findings establish the role of ATX/LPA in lung carcinogenesis, thus expanding the mechanistic links between pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. <i>Cancer Res; 78(13); 3634-44. ©2018 AACR</i>.\n",

      "CNS glia and neurons express connexins, the proteins that form gap junctions in vertebrates. We review the connexins expressed by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and discuss their proposed physiologic roles. Of the 21 members of the human connexin family, mutations in three are associated with significant central nervous system manifestations. For each, we review the phenotype and discuss possible mechanisms of disease. Mutations in GJB1, the gene for connexin 32 (Cx32) cause the second most common form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1X). Though the only consistent phenotype in CMT1X patients is a peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, CNS signs and symptoms have been found in some patients. Recessive mutations in GJC2, the gene for Cx47, are one cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD), which is characterized by nystagmus within the first 6 months of life, cerebellar ataxia by 4 years, and spasticity by 6 years of age. MRI imaging shows abnormal myelination. A different recessive GJC2 mutation causes a form of hereditary spastic paraparesis, which is a milder phenotype than PMLD. Dominant mutations in GJA1, the gene for Cx43, cause oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD), a pleitropic disorder characterized by oculo-facial abnormalities including micropthalmia, microcornia and hypoplastic nares, syndactyly of the fourth to fifth fingers and dental abnormalities. Neurologic manifestations, including spasticity and gait difficulties, are often but not universally seen. Recessive GJA1 mutations cause Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, a disorder showing substantial overlap with ODDD.

      "Shaping of the skeleton (modeling) and its maintenance throughout life (remodeling) require coordinated activity among bone forming (osteoblasts) and resorbing cells (osteoclasts) and osteocytes (bone embedded cells). The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) has emerged as a key modulator of skeletal growth and homeostasis. The skeletal developmental abnormalities present in oculodentodigital and craniometaphyseal dysplasias, both linked to Cx43 gene (GJA1) mutations, demonstrate that the skeleton is a major site of Cx43 action. Via direct action on osteolineage cells, including altering production of pro-osteoclastogenic factors, Cx43 contributes to peak bone mass acquisition, cortical modeling of long bones, and maintenance of bone quality. Cx43 also contributes in diverse ways to bone responsiveness to hormonal and mechanical signals. Skeletal biology research has revealed the complexity of Cx43 function; in addition to forming gap junctions and \"hemichannels\", Cx43 provides a scaffold for signaling molecules. Hence, Cx43 actively participates in generation and modulation of cellular signals driving skeletal development and homeostasis. Pharmacological interference with Cx43 may in the future help remedy deterioration of bone quality occurring with aging, disuse and hormonal imbalances.\n",

      "In epilepsy research, emphasis is put on exploring non-neuronal targets such as astrocytic proteins, since many patients remain pharmacoresistant to current treatments, which almost all target neuronal mechanisms. This paper reviews available data on astrocytic connexin43 (Cx43) signaling in seizures and epilepsy. Cx43 is a widely expressed transmembrane protein and the constituent of gap junctions (GJs) and hemichannels (HCs), allowing intercellular and extracellular communication, respectively. A plethora of research papers show altered Cx43 mRNA levels, protein expression, phosphorylation state, distribution and/or functional coupling in human epileptic tissue and experimental models. Human Cx43 mutations are linked to seizures as well, as 30% of patients with oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD), a rare genetic condition caused by mutations in the GJA1 gene coding for Cx43 protein, exhibit neurological symptoms including seizures. Cx30/Cx43 double knock-out mice show increased susceptibility to evoked epileptiform events in brain slices due to impaired GJ-mediated redistribution of K<sup>+</sup> and glutamate and display a higher frequency of spontaneous generalized chronic seizures in an epilepsy model. Contradictory, Cx30/Cx43 GJs can traffic nutrients to high-energy demanding neurons and initiate astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and hyper synchronization, thereby supporting proconvulsant effects. The general connexin channel blocker carbenoxolone and blockers from the fenamate family diminish epileptiform activity in vitro and improve seizure outcome in vivo. In addition, interventions with more selective peptide inhibitors of HCs display anticonvulsant actions. To conclude, further studies aiming to disentangle distinct roles of HCs and GJs are necessary and tools specifically targeting Cx43 HCs may facilitate the search for novel epilepsy treatments.\n",

      "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known for its high-metastatic potential. Here we report the identification of the proteoglycan serglycin as a functionally significant regulator of metastasis in this setting. Comparative genomic expression profiling of NPC cell line clones with high- and low-metastatic potential revealed the serglycin gene (SRGN) as one of the most upregulated genes in highly metastatic cells. RNAi-mediated inhibition of serglycin expression blocked serglycin secretion and the invasive motility of highly metastatic cells, reducing metastatic capacity in vivo. Conversely, serglycin overexpression in poorly metastatic cells increased their motile behavior and metastatic capacity in vivo. Growth rate was not influenced by serglycin in either highly or poorly metastatic cells. Secreted but not bacterial recombinant serglycin promoted motile behavior, suggesting a critical role for glycosylation in serglycin activity. Serglycin inhibition was associated with reduced expression of vimentin but not other epithelial-mesenchymal transition proteins. In clinical specimens, serglycin expression was elevated significantly in liver metastases from NPC relative to primary NPC tumors. We evaluated the prognostic value of serglycin by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays from 263 NPC patients followed by multivariate analyses. High serglycin expression in primary NPC was found to be an unfavorable independent indicator of distant metastasis-free and disease-free survival. Our findings establish that glycosylated serglycin regulates NPC metastasis via autocrine and paracrine routes, and that it serves as an independent prognostic indicator of metastasis-free survival and disease-free survival in NPC patients.\n",

      "Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an active role in promoting tumor progression. To further understand the communication between TME and tumor cells, this study aimed at investigating the involvement of CD44, a type I cell surface receptor, in the crosstalk between tumor cells and TME. We have previously shown that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan serglycin (SRGN), a CD44-interacting factor, was preferentially secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) for promoting tumor growth in breast cancer patients. In this study, we show that SRGN is overexpressed in primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), by both carcinoma and stromal cells. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we show that SRGN promotes NSCLC cell migration and invasion as well as colonization in the lung and liver in a CD44-dependent manner. SRGN induces lung cancer cell stemness, as demonstrated by its ability to enhance NSCLC cell sphere formation via Nanog induction, accompanied with increased chemoresistance and anoikis-resistance. SRGN promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition by enhancing vimentin expression via CD44/NF-κB/claudin-1 (CLDN1) axis. In support, CLDN1 and SRGN expression are tightly linked together in primary NSCLC. Most importantly, increased expression of SRGN and/or CLDN1 predicts poor prognosis in primary lung adenocarcinomas. In summary, we demonstrate that SRGN secreted by tumor cells and stromal components in the TME promotes malignant phenotypes through interacting with tumor cell receptor CD44, suggesting that a combined therapy targeting both CD44 and its ligands in the TME may be an attractive approach for cancer therapy.\n",

      "The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan serglycin (SRGN), a hematopoietic cell granule proteoglycan, has been implicated in promoting tumor metastasis; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the SRGN gene expression and its regulation as downstream signaling of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and tissues.\n",
      "The expression of SRGN was analyzed in CRC specimens for its correlation with progression and metastasis. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and transwell assay, the functional role and underlying mechanism of SRGN in CRC metastasis were elucidated. Thus, this study provides evidence of a critical role of SRGN in metastatic progression of CRC.\n",
      "Our results indicated that SRGN overexpression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in CRC specimens. SRGN overexpression promoted CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro; however, SRGN depletion exhibited contrasting effects. Mechanistic investigations revealed that HIF-1α regulated SRGN transcription via physically binding to a hypoxia response element in its promoter region.\n",
      "In conclusion, we demonstrated that dysregulated HIF-1α/SRGN signaling promotes CRC progression and metastasis. SRGN may serve as a potential candidate therapeutic target for metastatic CRC.\n",

      "The aldo-keto reductase (AKR) protein superfamily contains >190 members that fall into 16 families and are found in all phyla. These enzymes reduce carbonyl substrates such as: sugar aldehydes; keto-steroids, keto-prostaglandins, retinals, quinones, and lipid peroxidation by-products. Exceptions include the reduction of steroid double bonds catalyzed by AKR1D enzymes (5β-reductases); and the oxidation of proximate carcinogen trans-dihydrodiol polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; while the β-subunits of potassium gated ion channels (AKR6 family) control Kv channel opening. AKRs are usually 37kDa monomers, have an (α/β)8-barrel motif, display large loops at the back of the barrel which govern substrate specificity, and have a conserved cofactor binding domain. AKRs catalyze an ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism in which NAD(P)H cofactor binds first and leaves last. In enzymes that favor NADPH, the rate of release of NADP(+) is governed by a slow isomerization step which places an upper limit on kcat. AKRs retain a conserved catalytic tetrad consisting of Tyr55, Asp50, Lys84, and His117 (AKR1C9 numbering). There is conservation of the catalytic mechanism with short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) even though they show different protein folds. There are 15 human AKRs of these AKR1B1, AKR1C1-1C3, AKR1D1, and AKR1B10 have been implicated in diabetic complications, steroid hormone dependent malignancies, bile acid deficiency and defects in retinoic acid signaling, respectively. Inhibitor programs exist world-wide to target each of these enzymes to treat the aforementioned disorders. Inherited mutations in AKR1C and AKR1D1 enzymes are implicated in defects in the development of male genitalia and bile acid deficiency, respectively, and occur in evolutionarily conserved amino acids. The human AKRs have a large number of nsSNPs and splice variants, but in many instances functional genomics is lacking. AKRs and their variants are now poised to be interrogated using modern genomic and informatics approaches to determine their association with human health and disease.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Oxidative stress-induced inflammation is a major contributor to several disease conditions including sepsis, carcinogenesis and metastasis, diabetic complications, allergic asthma, uveitis and after cataract surgery posterior capsular opacification. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors and subsequent expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are characteristics of inflammatory disorders, we envisioned that by blocking the molecular signals of ROS that activate redox-sensitive transcription factors, various inflammatory diseases could be ameliorated. We have indeed demonstrated that ROS-induced lipid peroxidation-derived lipid aldehydes such as 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) and their glutathione-conjugates (e.g. GS-HNE) are efficiently reduced by aldose reductase to corresponding alcohols which mediate the inflammatory signals. Our results showed that inhibition of aldose reductase (AKR1B1) significantly prevented the inflammatory signals induced by cytokines, growth factors, endotoxins, high glucose, allergens and auto-immune reactions in cellular as well as animal models. We have demonstrated that AKR1B1 inhibitor, fidarestat, significantly prevents tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-, growth factors-, lipopolysachharide (LPS)-, and environmental allergens-induced inflammatory signals that cause various inflammatory diseases. In animal models of inflammatory diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular, uveitis, asthma, and cancer (colon, breast, prostate and lung) and metastasis, inhibition of AKR1B1 significantly ameliorated the disease. Our results from various cellular and animal models representing a number of inflammatory conditions suggest that ROS-induced inflammatory response could be reduced by inhibition of AKR1B1, thereby decreasing the progression of the disease and if the therapy is initiated early, the disease could be eliminated. Since fidarestat has already undergone phase III clinical trial for diabetic neuropathy and found to be safe, though clinically not very effective, our results indicate that it can be developed for the therapy of a number of inflammation-related diseases. Our results thus offer a novel therapeutic approach to treat a wide array of inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "Aldo-keto reductase 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) is pathogenically involved in diabetic complications by driving glucose flux through polyol pathway; a variety of AKR1B1 inhibitors has been developed for the treatment of diabetic complications and a body of invaluable preclinical and clinical data have been collected through decades' efforts. Recent studies have shown that some AKR1B1 inhibitors demonstrate strong inhibitory activity to aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), a protein identical to AKR1B1, in vitro and in cancer cells. AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 are overexpressed in human tumors, such as liver, breast, and lung cancer, and may play a critical role in the development and progression of cancer through carbonyl detoxification, retinoic acid homeostatic regulation, and lipid metabolic control, as well as the activation of tobacco smoke carcinogens. Therefore, AKR1B1 inhibitors may represent a novel class of antitumor agents; and the clinical data assembled in diabetic clinics would greatly assist the transition of these inhibitors to cancer clinics. This article summaries the current understanding of the expression and function of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 in human cancers and reviews the patents and papers of AKR1B1 inhibitors. Authors' opinions concerning the current and future development of AKR1B1 and/or AKR1B10-specific inhibitors are discussed.\n",

      "ARID1A, encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, is mutated in ∼50% of clear cell ovarian carcinoma (OCCC) cases. Here we show that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) by driving inflammasome-regulated immunomodulating pyroptosis in ARID1A-inactivated OCCCs. SWI/SNF inactivation downregulates the rate-limiting enzymes in the mevalonate pathway such as HMGCR and HMGCS1, which creates a dependence on the residual activity of the pathway in ARID1A-inactivated cells. Inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway such as simvastatin suppresses the growth of ARID1A mutant, but not wild-type, OCCCs. In addition, simvastatin synergizes with anti-PD-L1 antibody in a genetic OCCC mouse model driven by conditional Arid1a inactivation and in a humanized immunocompetent ARID1A mutant patient-derived OCCC mouse model. Our data indicate that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway simultaneously suppresses tumor cell growth and boosts antitumor immunity by promoting pyroptosis, which synergizes with ICB in suppressing ARID1A-mutated cancers.\n",

      "As competitive HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, statins not only reduce cholesterol and improve cardiovascular risk, but also exhibit pleiotropic effects that are independent of their lipid-lowering effects. Among them, the anti-cancer properties of statins have attracted much attention and indicated the potential of statins as repurposed drugs for the treatment of cancer. A large number of clinical and epidemiological studies have described the anticancer properties of statins, but the evidence for anticancer effectiveness of statins is inconsistent. It may be that certain molecular subtypes of cancer are more vulnerable to statin therapy than others. Whether statins have clinical anticancer effects is still an active area of research. Statins appear to enhance the efficacy and address the shortcomings associated with conventional cancer treatments, suggesting that statins should be considered in the context of combined therapies for cancer. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the potential of statins in anti-cancer treatments. We discuss the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer properties of statins and their effects on different malignancies. We also provide recommendations for the design of future well-designed clinical trials of the anti-cancer efficacy of statins.\n",

      "3β-Hydroxysterol Δ(24)-reductase (DHCR24) catalyzes the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. This ultimate step of cholesterol biosynthesis appears to be remarkable in its diverse functions and the number of diseases it is implicated in from vascular disease to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to cancer to Alzheimer's disease. This review summarizes the present knowledge on the DHCR24 gene, sterol Δ(24)-reductase protein and the regulation of both. In addition, the functions of desmosterol, DHCR24 and their roles in human diseases are discussed. It is apparent that DHCR24 exerts more complex effects than what would be expected based on the enzymatic activity of sterol Δ(24)-reduction alone, such as its influence in modulating oxidative stress. Increasing information about DHCR24 membrane association, processing, enzymatic regulation and interaction partners will provide further fundamental insights into DHCR24 and its many and varied biological roles.\n",

      "In our analysis of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for plasma triglyceride (TG) levels [logarithm of odds (LOD) = 3.7] on human chromosome 7q36, we examined 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across INSIG1, a biological candidate gene in the region. Insulin-induced genes (INSIGs) are feedback mediators of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in animals, but their role in human lipid regulation is unclear. In our cohort, the INSIG1 promoter SNP rs2721 was associated with TG levels (P = 2 x 10(-3) in 1,560 individuals of the original linkage cohort, P = 8 x 10(-4) in 920 unrelated individuals of the replication cohort, combined P = 9.9 x 10(-6)). Individuals homozygous for the T allele had 9% higher TG levels and 2-fold lower expression of INSIG1 in surgical liver biopsy samples when compared with individuals homozygous for the G allele. Also, the T allele showed additional binding of nuclear proteins from HepG2 liver cells in gel shift assays. Finally, the variant rs7566605 in INSIG2, the only homolog of INSIG1, enhances the effect of rs2721 (P = 0.00117). The variant rs2721 alone explains 5.4% of the observed linkage in our cohort, suggesting that additional, yet-undiscovered genes and sequence variants in the QTL interval also contribute to alterations in TG levels in humans.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a common inherited disorder characterized by abnormally elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from birth, which in time can lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most cases are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in LDLR, which encodes the LDL receptor, although mutations in other genes coding for proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism or LDLR function and processing, such as APOB and PCSK9, can also be causative, although less frequently. Several sets of diagnostic criteria for familial hypercholesterolaemia are available; common diagnostic features are an elevated LDL cholesterol level and a family history of hypercholesterolaemia or (premature) CVD. DNA-based methods to identify the underlying genetic defect are desirable but not essential for diagnosis. Cascade screening can contribute to early diagnosis of the disease in family members of an affected individual, which is crucial because familial hypercholesterolaemia can be asymptomatic for decades. Clinical severity depends on the nature of the gene that harbours the causative mutation, among other factors, and is further modulated by the type of mutation. Lifelong LDL cholesterol-lowering treatment substantially improves CVD-free survival and longevity. Statins are the first-line therapy, but additional drugs, such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, PCSK9 inhibitors and other emerging therapies, are often required.\n",

      "Autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) has been identified as a major risk factor for coronary vascular disease (CVD) and is associated with mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene. Since 1991 DNA samples from clinically diagnosed ADH patients have been routinely analyzed for the presence of LDLR and APOB gene mutations. As of 2001, 1,641 index patients (164 index patients per year) had been identified, while from 2001 onward a more sensitive, high-throughput system was used, resulting in the identification of 1,177 new index patients (average=294 index patients per year). Of these 1,177 index cases, 131 different causative genetic variants in the LDLR gene and six different causative mutations in the APOB gene were new for the Dutch population. Of these 131 mutations, 83 LDLR and four APOB gene mutations had not been reported before. The inclusion of all 2,818 index cases into the national screening program for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) resulted in the identification of 7,079 relatives who carried a mutation that causes ADH. Screening of the LDLR and APOB genes in clinically diagnosed FH patients resulted in approximately 77% of the patients being identified as carriers of a causative mutation. The population of patients with ADH was divided into three genetically distinct groups: carriers of an LDLR mutation (FH), carriers of an APOB mutation (FDB), and non-LDLR/non-APOB patients (FH3). No differences were found with regard to untreated cholesterol levels, response to therapy, and onset of CVD. However, all groups were at an increased risk for CVD. Therefore, to ultimately identify all individuals with ADH, the identification of new genes and mutations in the genes that cause ADH is of crucial importance for the ongoing national program to identify patients with ADH by genetic cascade screening.\n",

      "This article reviews the discovery of PCSK9, its structure-function characteristics, and its presently known and proposed novel biological functions. The major critical function of PCSK9 deduced from human and mouse studies, as well as cellular and structural analyses, is its role in increasing the levels of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDLc), via its ability to enhance the sorting and escort of the cell surface LDL receptor (LDLR) to lysosomes. This implicates the binding of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 to the EGF-A domain of the LDLR. This also requires the presence of the C-terminal Cys/His-rich domain, its binding to the secreted cytosolic cyclase associated protein 1, and possibly another membrane-bound \"protein X\". Curiously, in PCSK9-deficient mice, an alternative to the downregulation of the surface levels of the LDLR by PCSK9 is taking place in the liver of female mice in a 17β-estradiol-dependent manner by still an unknown mechanism. Recent studies have extended our understanding of the biological functions of PCSK9, namely its implication in septic shock, vascular inflammation, viral infections (Dengue; SARS-CoV-2) or immune checkpoint modulation in cancer via the regulation of the cell surface levels of the T-cell receptor and MHC-I, which govern the antitumoral activity of CD8+ T cells. Because PCSK9 inhibition may be advantageous in these processes, the availability of injectable safe PCSK9 inhibitors that reduces by 50% to 60% LDLc above the effect of statins is highly valuable. Indeed, injectable PCSK9 monoclonal antibody or small interfering RNA could be added to current immunotherapies in cancer/metastasis.\n",

      "Activation of ferroptosis, a recently described mechanism of regulated cell death, dramatically inhibits growth of ovarian cancer cells. Given the importance of lipid metabolism in ferroptosis and the key role of lipids in ovarian cancer, we examined the contribution to ferroptosis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1, <i>SCD</i>), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis in ovarian cancer cells. SCD1 was highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissue, cell lines, and a genetic model of ovarian cancer stem cells. Inhibition of SCD1 induced lipid oxidation and cell death. Conversely, overexpression of <i>SCD</i> or exogenous administration of its C16:1 and C18:1 products, palmitoleic acid or oleate, protected cells from death. Inhibition of SCD1 induced both ferroptosis and apoptosis. Inhibition of SCD1 decreased CoQ<sub>10</sub>, an endogenous membrane antioxidant whose depletion has been linked to ferroptosis, while concomitantly decreasing unsaturated fatty acyl chains in membrane phospholipids and increasing long-chain saturated ceramides, changes previously linked to apoptosis. Simultaneous triggering of two death pathways suggests SCD1 inhibition may be an effective component of antitumor therapy, because overcoming this dual mechanism of cell death may present a significant barrier to the emergence of drug resistance. Supporting this concept, we observed that inhibition of SCD1 significantly potentiated the antitumor effect of ferroptosis inducers in both ovarian cancer cell lines and a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Our results suggest that the use of combined treatment with SCD1 inhibitors and ferroptosis inducers may provide a new therapeutic strategy for patients with ovarian cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of SCD1 inhibitors and ferroptosis inducers may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ovarian cancer patients.<i>See related commentary by Carbone and Melino, p. 5149</i>.\n",

      "In Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein (αS) pathologically impacts the brain, a highly lipid-rich organ. We investigated how alterations in αS or lipid/fatty acid homeostasis affect each other. Lipidomic profiling of human αS-expressing yeast revealed increases in oleic acid (OA, 18:1), diglycerides, and triglycerides. These findings were recapitulated in rodent and human neuronal models of αS dyshomeostasis (overexpression; patient-derived triplication or E46K mutation; E46K mice). Preventing lipid droplet formation or augmenting OA increased αS yeast toxicity; suppressing the OA-generating enzyme stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) was protective. Genetic or pharmacological SCD inhibition ameliorated toxicity in αS-overexpressing rat neurons. In a C. elegans model, SCD knockout prevented αS-induced dopaminergic degeneration. Conversely, we observed detrimental effects of OA on αS homeostasis: in human neural cells, excess OA caused αS inclusion formation, which was reversed by SCD inhibition. Thus, monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism is pivotal for αS-induced neurotoxicity, and inhibiting SCD represents a novel PD therapeutic approach.\n",

      "Increasing evidence suggests that stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), the rate-limiting enzyme of monounsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, is an important factor in the pathogenesis of lipid-induced insulin resistance. Mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 gene have improved glucose tolerance compared to wild-type mice, despite lower fasting plasma insulin levels. Increased SCD activity has been found in insulin-resistant humans and animals, whereas SCD1 deficiency attenuates both diet- and genetically-induced impairment of insulin action. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrates (IRS1 and IRS2), and on Akt has been shown to be the major step in insulin signaling that is altered due to the lack of SCD1. In this review we discuss perturbations in cell signaling and lipid metabolism cascades in insulin-sensitive tissues due to SCD1 deficiency. In particular, we address the role of cellular signaling molecules including free fatty acids, ceramides, fatty acyl-CoAs, AMP-activated protein kinase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B as well as of membrane fluidity. While the precise mechanism of SCD action on insulin signaling remains to be clarified, current findings on SCD point to a very promising novel target for the treatment of insulin resistance.\n",

      "Increased fatty acid synthesis is required to meet the demand for membrane expansion of rapidly growing cells. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is upregulated or activated in several types of cancer, and inhibition of ACLY arrests proliferation of cancer cells. Here we show that ACLY is acetylated at lysine residues 540, 546, and 554 (3K). Acetylation at these three lysine residues is stimulated by P300/calcium-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferase under high glucose and increases ACLY stability by blocking its ubiquitylation and degradation. Conversely, the protein deacetylase sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) deacetylates and destabilizes ACLY. Substitution of 3K abolishes ACLY ubiquitylation and promotes de novo lipid synthesis, cell proliferation, and tumor growth. Importantly, 3K acetylation of ACLY is increased in human lung cancers. Our study reveals a crosstalk between acetylation and ubiquitylation by competing for the same lysine residues in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis and cell growth in response to glucose.\n",

Cloning of the coding sequences and chromosomal localization of the desaturase encoding genes fatty acid desaturase 1 and 2 (FADS1 and FADS2) opened the way for analyses of genetic factors as regulators of desaturase activity and LC-PUFA homeostasis. The present review summarizes the recent association studies on FADS genotypes and LC-PUFA levels and suggests ideas how FADS genotypes can be integrated in future research.\n",
      "An initial candidate gene study reported highly significant associations between FADS gene cluster polymorphisms and fatty acid levels in serum phospholipids with an extraordinary high genetically explained variance for arachidonic acid levels of 28.5%. Carriers of the minor alleles had enhanced levels of desaturase substrates and decreased levels of desaturase products, suggesting a decline in desaturase expression or activity because of the polymorphisms. These results were replicated in several association studies additionally showing an effect in different human tissues as well as in a recent genome-wide association study on LC-PUFA levels.\n",

      "ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a cytosolic homotetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrate and coenzyme A (CoA) to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, with the simultaneous hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate. Interestingly, ACLY is a strategic enzyme linking both the glycolytic and lipidic metabolism. In tumour cells characterized by an altered energetic metabolism, an increased glucose uptake and an accelerated glycolytic flux lead to an intensified production of mitochondrial citrate. Once transported to the cytosol, citrate is here converted by ACLY to acetyl-CoA, an essential biosynthetic precursor for fatty acid synthesis and mevalonate pathway. ACLY expression and activity proved to be aberrantly expressed in many types of tumours, and its pharmacological or genetic inhibition significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Increasing evidences highlight the central role of ACLY, conferring a great therapeutic potential to this enzyme as a key target for the treatment of cancer. ACLY inhibitors, previously developed for metabolic disorders, have recently attracted interest as promising anti-cancer agents. After a brief introduction to the structure and the pathophysiological role of ACLY, this review article provides an overview of the main ACLY inhibitors reported in the literature.\n",

      "PGAM5 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates multiple metabolic pathways and contributes to tumorigenesis in a poorly understood manner. We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1. Thus, the balance between PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of ME1 S336 and ACAT1-mediated acetylation of K337 strongly influences NADPH generation, lipid metabolism, and the susceptibility to colorectal tumorigenesis.\n",

      "Malic enzyme 1 (ME1) is a cytosolic protein that catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate while concomitantly generating NADPH from NADP. Early studies identified ME1 as a mediator of intermediary metabolism primarily through its participatory roles in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. ME1 was one of the first identified insulin-regulated genes in liver and adipose and is a transcriptional target of thyroxine. Multiple studies have since documented that ME1 is pro-oncogenic in numerous epithelial cancers. In tumor cells, the reduction of ME1 gene expression or the inhibition of its activity resulted in decreases in proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and in vitro migration, and conversely, in promotion of oxidative stress, apoptosis and/or cellular senescence. Here, we integrate recent findings to highlight ME1's role in oncogenesis, provide a rationale for its nexus with metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and raise the prospects of targeting the cytosolic NADPH network to improve therapeutic approaches against multiple cancers.\n",

      "Lipogenesis plays a critical role in colorectal carcinogenesis, but precisely how remains unclear. Here, we show that ERK2 phosphorylates ME1 at T103, thereby inhibiting its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and enhancing its interaction with USP19. USP19 antagonizes RNF1-mediated ME1 degradation by deubiquitination, which in turn promotes lipid metabolism and NADPH production and suppresses ROS. Meanwhile, ROS dramatically increases PD-L1 mRNA levels through accelerating expression of the transcription factor NRF2. Increased lipid metabolism is correlated with ERK2 activity and colorectal carcinogenesis in human patients. Therefore, the combination of ERK2 inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 antibody significantly inhibits spontaneous and chemically induced colorectal carcinogenesis. Collectively, the USP19-ME1 axis plays a vital role in colorectal carcinogenesis and may also provide a potential therapeutic target.\n",

      "Aging constitutes the key risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Human longevity and healthy aging are complex phenotypes influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. The fact that genetic contribution to lifespan strongly increases with greater age provides basis for research on which \"protective genes\" are carried by long-lived individuals. Studies have consistently revealed FOXO (Forkhead box O) transcription factors as important determinants in aging and longevity. FOXO proteins represent a subfamily of transcription factors conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals that act as key regulators of longevity downstream of insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling. Invertebrate genomes have one FOXO gene, while mammals have four FOXO genes: FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6. In mammals, this subfamily is involved in a wide range of crucial cellular processes regulating stress resistance, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Their role in longevity determination is complex and remains to be fully elucidated. Throughout this review, the mechanisms by which FOXO factors contribute to longevity will be discussed in diverse animal models, from Hydra to mammals. Moreover, compelling evidence of FOXOs as contributors for extreme longevity and health span in humans will be addressed.\n",

FOXE3-FOXD2 (1p33), FOXQ1-FOXF2-FOXC1 (6p25.3), and FOXF1-FOXC2-FOXL1 (16q24.1) loci are FOX gene clusters within the human genome. Members of FOX subfamilies A-G, I-L and Q were grouped into class 1 FOX proteins, while members of FOX subfamilies H and M-P were grouped into class 2 FOX proteins. C-terminal basic region within the FOX domain was the common feature of class 1 FOX proteins. FOXH1 and FOXO1 mRNAs are expressed in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. FOXC1, FOXC2, FOXE1, FOXE3, FOXL2, FOXN1, FOXP2 and FOXP3 genes are mutated in human congenital disorders. FOXA1 gene is amplified and over-expressed in esophageal and lung cancer. FOXM1 gene is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer and basal cell carcinoma due to the transcriptional regulation by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. FOXO1 gene is fused to PAX3 or PAX7 genes in rhabdomyosarcoma. FOXO3 and FOXO4 genes are fused to MLL gene in hematological malignancies. Deregulation of FOX family genes leads to congenital disorders, diabetes mellitus, or carcinogenesis. Expression profiles, genetic alterations and epigenetic changes of FOX family genes as well as binding proteins and target genes of FOX family transcription factors should be comprehensively investigated to develop novel therapeutics and preventives for human diseases.\n",

      "Several pathologies such as neurodegeneration and cancer are associated with aging, which is affected by many genetic and environmental factors. Healthy aging conceives human longevity, possibly due to carrying the defensive genes. For instance, FOXO (forkhead box O) genes determine human longevity. FOXO transcription factors are involved in the regulation of longevity phenomenon via insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling. Only one FOXO gene (FOXO DAF-16) exists in invertebrates, while four FOXO genes, that is, FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6 are found in mammals. These four transcription factors are involved in the multiple cellular pathways, which regulate growth, stress resistance, metabolism, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis in mammals. However, the accurate mode of longevity by FOXO factors is unclear until now. This article describes briefly the existing knowledge that is related to the role of FOXO factors in human longevity.\n",

      "Aminopeptidase N (APN; encoded by ANPEP) expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays representing 267 radical prostatectomy (RP) and 111 conservatively treated (CT) PC patients. Clinical end points were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), respectively. The ANPEP promoter methylation levels were determined by bisulphite sequencing or MethyLight analysis in 278 nonmalignant and PC tissue samples, and in cell lines.\n",
      "The APN expression was significantly downregulated in PC compared with nonmalignant prostate tissue samples. Aberrant promoter hypermethylation was frequently observed in PC tissue samples, and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced ANPEP expression in three hypermethylated prostate cell lines, suggesting epigenetic silencing. Negative APN immunoreactivity was significantly associated with short RFS and short CSS in the RP and CT cohort, respectively, independently of routine clinicopathological predictors. Combining APN with a known angiogenesis marker (vascular endothelial growth factor or microvessel density) improved risk prediction significantly in both cohorts.\n",
      "Our results suggest negative APN immunoreactivity as a new independent adverse prognostic factor for patients with clinically localised PC and, furthermore, that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in silencing of ANPEP in PC.\n",

      "The role of vascular endothelial cell injury in the course of atherosclerosis (AS) has attracted increasing attention. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are demonstrated to be the biomarker for the diagnosis of AS. This study investigated the mechanism of lncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in AS. Microarray data of AS obtained from GEO database showed that lncRNA TUG1 was differentially expressed in AS samples. TUG1 expression was upregulated in ox-LDL-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-treated HUVECs were then transfected with sh-TUG1. TUG1 silencing promoted proliferation and migration of ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. TUG1 bound to Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Runx2 silencing promoted proliferation and migration of HUVECs. The downstream genes of Runx2 were predicted by hTFtarget database. The binding site of Runx2 and Aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) was determined. Runx2 silencing reversed the repression effect of overexpressing ANPEP on cell proliferation and migration. TUG1 silencing inhibited ANPEP expression via Runx2 to promote HUVEC proliferation and migration. A mouse model of AS was established. The area of atherosclerotic lesions of mouse aorta was detected, and vascular re-endothelialization was evaluated. TUG1 silencing promoted vascular injury repairing and inhibited AS in vivo. In conclusion, TUG1 silencing enhanced proliferation and migration of ox-LDL-treated HUVECs and promoted vascular injury repairing in vivo via the Runx2/ANPEP axis.\n",

      "Aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) is a membrane-bound zinc-dependent peptidase. Although it is widely believed that ANPEP acts as an important angiogenesis regulatory factor, there are few studies about its function in the female reproductive system. In our previous research, we applied Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) to analyze the influence of different controlled superovulation treatments for Assisted Reproductive Technology, In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer (IVF-ET)) patients from a global proteomic perspective to search for potential biomarkers associated with endometrium receptivity and embryo implantation. ANPEP is one of the proteins that demonstrated differential expression between different treatment groups and may be closely associated with endometrial receptivity. In this study, we assessed the expression of ANPEP in the endometrium of mice at different ages and found it to be highest in the mature period. We also detected ANPEP expression in the endometrium of IVF-ET patients in the proliferative, preimplantation and implantation stages, and the highest expression level of ANPEP was found in the last group. Human primary endometrial stromal cells were infected with an adenovirus expression vector containing the ANPEP gene and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein; the mRNA levels of HOXA-10, LIF, and integrin β3 were found to be increased. Therefore, we conclude that ANPEP could be involved in the regulation of endometrial receptivity.\n",

      "Initial studies found increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in patients with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, COVID-19 might also predispose infected individuals to hyperglycaemia. Interacting with other risk factors, hyperglycaemia might modulate immune and inflammatory responses, thus predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 and possible lethal outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; although dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) might also act as a binding target. Preliminary data, however, do not suggest a notable effect of glucose-lowering DPP4 inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Owing to their pharmacological characteristics, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors might cause adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 and so cannot be recommended. Currently, insulin should be the main approach to the control of acute glycaemia. Most available evidence does not distinguish between the major types of diabetes mellitus and is related to type 2 diabetes mellitus owing to its high prevalence. However, some limited evidence is now available on type 1 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19. Most of these conclusions are preliminary, and further investigation of the optimal management in patients with diabetes mellitus is warranted.\n",

By cleaving dipeptides from peptides with a proline or alanine in the penultimate position at the N-terminus, it regulates the activity of incretin hormones, chemokines and many other peptides. Due to these effects and interactions with other molecules, a tumor promoting or suppressing role can be attributed to CD26/DPP4. In this review, we discuss the existing evidence on the expression of soluble or membrane-bound CD26/DPP4 in malignant diseases, along with the most recent findings on CD26/DPP4 as a therapeutic target in specific malignancies. The expression and possible involvement of the related DPP8 and DPP9 in cancer are also reviewed. A higher expression of CD26/DPP4 is found in a wide variety of tumor entities, however more research on CD26/DPP4 in the tumor microenvironment is needed to fully explore its use as a tumor biomarker. Circulating soluble CD26/DPP4 has also been studied as a cancer biomarker, however, the observed decrease in most cancer patients does not seem to be cancer specific. Encouraging results from experimental work and a recently reported first phase clinical trial targeting CD26/DPP4 in mesothelioma, renal and urological tumors pave the way for follow-up clinical studies, also in other tumor entities, possibly leading to the development of more effective complementary therapies against cancer.\n",

      "The incretin hormones glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released from the intestine following oral ingestion of nutrients. Incretins promote insulin secretion, while GLP-1 also inhibits glucagon release and gastric emptying, minimizing postprandial glucose excursions. The incretins share similar effects on the pancreatic β cell; however, there are a number of differences in extrapancreatic actions. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with abnormal incretin physiology, and although treatment with GIP is ineffective, GLP-1 effects are preserved. The current incretin-based approaches to T2DM include the GLP-1 agonists that are resistant to the serine protease dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4), which normally rapidly degrades the incretins, and DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i). Incretin-based treatments have provoked much interest due to use-associated weight loss (GLP-1 agonists), minimal hypoglycemia, and potential for positive effects on pancreatic β cell biology and the cardiovascular system. However, the long-term safety of these agents has yet to be established. This review outlines the current understanding of incretin biology, available data pertaining to incretin-based treatment in T2DM, and differences between GLP-1 and DPP4i therapy.\n",

      "The histaminergic system (HS) has a critical role in cognition, sleep and other behaviors. Although not well studied in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the HS is implicated in many neurological disorders, some of which share comorbidity with ASD, including Tourette syndrome (TS). Preliminary studies suggest that antagonism of histamine receptors 1-3 reduces symptoms and specific behaviors in ASD patients and relevant animal models. In addition, the HS mediates neuroinflammation, which may be heightened in ASD. Together, this suggests that the HS may also be altered in ASD. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we investigated genome-wide expression, as well as a focused gene set analysis of key HS genes (HDC, HNMT, HRH1, HRH2, HRH3 and HRH4) in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) initially in 13 subjects with ASD and 39 matched controls. At the genome level, eight transcripts were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05), six of which were small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). There was no significant diagnosis effect on any of the individual HS genes but expression of the gene set of HNMT, HRH1, HRH2 and HRH3 was significantly altered. Curated HS gene sets were also significantly differentially expressed. Differential expression analysis of these gene sets in an independent RNA-seq ASD data set from DLPFC of 47 additional subjects confirmed these findings. Understanding the physiological relevance of an altered HS may suggest new therapeutic options for the treatment of ASD.\n",

      "Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) catalyzes a major pathway in histamine metabolism. Levels of HNMT activity in humans are regulated by inheritance. We set out to study the molecular basis for this genetic regulation. Northern blot analysis showed that HNMT is highly expressed in the kidney, so we determined levels of enzyme activity and thermal stability in 127 human renal biopsy samples. DNA was isolated from 12 kidney samples with widely different HNMT phenotypes, and exons of the HNMT gene were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction. In these 12 samples, we observed a C314T transition that resulted in a Thr105Ile change in encoded amino acid, as well as an A939G transition within the 3'-untranslated region. All remaining renal biopsy samples then were genotyped for these two variant sequences. Frequencies of the alleles encoding Thr105 and Ile105 in the 114 samples studied were 0.90 and 0.10, respectively, whereas frequencies for the nucleotide A939 and G alleles were 0.79 and 0.21, respectively. Kidney samples with the allele encoding Ile105 had significantly lower levels of HNMT activity and thermal stability than did those with the allele that encoded Thr105. These observations were confirmed by transient expression in COS-1 cells of constructs that contained all four alleles for these two polymorphisms. COS-1 cells transfected with the Ile105 allele had significantly lower HNMT activity and immunoreactive HNMT protein than did those transfected with the Thr105 allele. These observations will make it possible to test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms for HNMT may play a role in the pathophysiology of human disease.\n",

      "Histamine is inactivated by the histamine-metabolizing enzyme histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) in bronchus, kidney, and the central nervous system. HNMT seems to be localized in the cytoplasm, but histamine is unable to easily enter the intracellular space. Therefore, two hypotheses can be elicited: one is the plasma membrane hypothesis that HNMT can be translocated to the plasma membrane and function at the cell surface under growth factor stimulation and the other is the transporter hypothesis that organic cation transporter (OCT)-2 and -3 can function as a histamine transporter as well. To investigate the involvement of OCT2, HEK293 cells stably double transfected with C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HNMT cDNA and/or C-terminal myc-tagged rat OCT2 were prepared for analysis of HNMT activity associated with OCT2 function. After 60-min incubation of these cells with PBS including HA (100 microM), N(tau)-methylhistamine (MHA) concentration of the supernatants was determined by the HPLC-fluorometry method. MHA from cells with HNMT plus OCT-2 was produced at about 3-fold higher level than that from cells with HNMT alone, suggesting that OCT-2 could function as a histamine transporter as well and that HNMT function could partly depend on OCT-2 transporter activity. Using OCT-3 knockout (OCT-3-/-) mice, histamine content and survival rates were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia model. Without LPS stimulation, histamine content was compared between OCT-3-/- and wild mice. Histamine content in the spleen of OCT-3-/- mice was higher than that f wild mice. With LPS stimulation, the survival rate of OCT-3-/- mice was significantly decreased 12 h after LPS (20 mg/kg) stimulation, suggesting that before immunological stimulation, a higher content of histamine in spleen could stimulate histamine receptors in mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, as well as T lymphocytes and explaining the decreased survival rate in OCT-3-/- mice possibly due to the functional changes of immunological cells.\n",

      "Glioblastoma multiforme remains the deadliest malignant brain tumor, with glioma stem cells (GSC) contributing to treatment resistance and tumor recurrence. We have identified MAPK-interacting kinases (MNK) as potential targets for the GSC population in glioblastoma multiforme. Isoform-level subtyping using The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that both MNK genes (MKNK1 and MKNK2) are upregulated in mesenchymal glioblastoma multiforme as compared with other subtypes. Expression of MKNK1 is associated with increased glioma grade and correlated with the mesenchymal GSC marker, CD44, and coexpression of MKNK1 and CD44 predicts poor survival in glioblastoma multiforme. In established and patient-derived cell lines, pharmacologic MNK inhibition using LY2801653 (merestinib) inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, a crucial effector for MNK-induced mRNA translation in cancer cells and a marker of transformation. Importantly, merestinib inhibited growth of GSCs grown as neurospheres as determined by extreme limiting dilution analysis. When the effects of merestinib were assessed in vivo using an intracranial xenograft mouse model, improved overall survival was observed in merestinib-treated mice. Taken together, these data provide strong preclinical evidence that pharmacologic MNK inhibition targets mesenchymal glioblastoma multiforme and its GSC population.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The respiratory epithelium is lined by mucus, a gel consisting of water, ions, proteins, and macromolecules. The major macromolecular components of mucus are the mucin glycoproteins, which are critical for local defense of the airway. There are three classes of mucins in the airways: those that are secreted but do not polymerize (MUC7), those that are secreted and polymerize to form gels (MUC5AC, MUC5B), and those that have transmembrane domains and are cell surface associated (MUC1, MUC4, MUC16, MUC20). The mucins are regulated at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and epigenetic levels, and posttranslational modifications play an important role in mucin binding and clearance of microbes and pollutants. The development of mice deficient in specific mucins, and the cystic fibrosis pig, has greatly advanced our understanding of the role of mucins as innate immune mediators and how mucins and mucus contribute to lung disease. These observations suggest new strategies to ameliorate mucus obstruction by targeting mucociliary clearance and mucin hyperconcentration. Furthermore, a polymorphism in the promoter of MUC5B is strongly associated with risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis, supporting a novel function for MUC5B to influence interstitial lung disease. Exciting new data support the concept not only that mucins and mucus are important for lung homeostasis and protection from environmental threats but also that goblet cells play an important role as regulators of innate immune function. These insights into the innate immune properties of mucins and goblet cells support a shift from the current paradigm of repressing increased mucin expression to targeting regulation of specific mucins and the abnormal airway milieu.\n",

      "To characterize the regional distribution of MUC5B and MUC5AC in normal/healthy human airways and assess which cell types produce these mucins, referenced to the club cell secretory protein (CCSP).\n",
      "Multiple airway regions from 16 nonsmoker lungs without a history of lung disease were studied. MUC5AC, MUC5B, and CCSP expression/colocalization were assessed by RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in five lungs with histologically healthy airways. Droplet digital PCR and cell cultures were performed for absolute quantification of MUC5AC/5B ratios and protein secretion, respectively.\n",
      "Submucosal glands expressed MUC5B, but not MUC5AC. However, MUC5B was also extensively expressed in superficial epithelia throughout the airways except for the terminal bronchioles. Morphometric calculations revealed that the distal airway superficial epithelium was the predominant site for MUC5B expression, whereas MUC5AC expression was concentrated in proximal, cartilaginous airways. RNA in situ hybridization revealed MUC5AC and MUC5B were colocalized with CCSP-positive secretory cells in proximal superficial epithelia, whereas MUC5B and CCSP-copositive cells dominated distal regions.\n",
      "In normal/healthy human airways, MUC5B is the dominant secretory mucin in the superficial epithelium and glands, with distal airways being a major site of expression. MUC5B and MUC5AC expression is a property of CCSP-positive secretory cells in superficial airway epithelia.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Mucus plays a vital role in protecting the lungs from environmental factors, but conversely, in muco-obstructive airway disease, mucus becomes pathologic. In its protective role, mucus entraps microbes and particles removing them from the lungs via the co-ordinated beating of motile cilia. This mechanism of lung defence is reliant upon a flowing mucus gel, and the major macromolecular components that determine the rheological properties of mucus are the polymeric mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B. These large O-linked glycoproteins have direct roles in maintaining lung homeostasis. MUC5B is essential for interaction with the ciliary clearance system and MUC5AC is up-regulated in response to allergic inflammatory challenge. Mucus with abnormal biophysical properties is a feature of muco-obstructive respiratory disease and can result from many different mechanisms including alterations in mucin polymer assembly, mucin concentration and the macromolecular form in mucus, as well as changes in airway surface hydration, pH and ion composition. The abnormal mucus results in defective lung protection via compromised ciliary clearance, leading to infection and inflammation.\n",

      "The most prevalent neurological disorders of myelin include perinatal brain injury leading to cerebral palsy in infants and multiple sclerosis in adults. Although these disorders have distinct etiologies, they share a common neuropathological feature of failed progenitor differentiation into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes and lack of myelin, for which there is an unmet clinical need. Here, we reveal that a molecular pathology common to both disorders is dysregulation of activin receptors and that activin receptor signaling is required for the majority of myelin generation in development and following injury. Using a constitutive conditional knockout of all activin receptor signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, we discovered this signaling to be required for myelination via regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin compaction. These processes were found to be dependent on the activin receptor subtype Acvr2a, which is expressed during oligodendrocyte differentiation and axonal ensheathment in development and following myelin injury. During efficient myelin regeneration, Acvr2a upregulation was seen to coincide with downregulation of Acvr2b, a receptor subtype with relatively higher ligand affinity; Acvr2b was shown to be dispensable for activin receptor-driven oligodendrocyte differentiation and its overexpression was sufficient to impair the abovementioned ligand-driven responses. In actively myelinating or remyelinating areas of human perinatal brain injury and multiple sclerosis tissue, respectively, oligodendrocyte lineage cells expressing Acvr2a outnumbered those expressing Acvr2b, whereas in non-repairing lesions Acvr2b+ cells were increased. Thus, we propose that following human white matter injury, this increase in Acvr2b expression would sequester ligand and consequently impair Acvr2a-driven oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation. Our results demonstrate dysregulated activin receptor signaling in common myelin disorders and reveal Acvr2a as a novel therapeutic target for myelin generation following injury across the lifespan.\n",

      "TGF-β family signaling pathways, including TGF-β and BMP pathways, are widely involved in the regulation of health and diseases through downstream SMADs, which are also regulated by multiple validated mechanisms, such as genetic regulation, epigenetic regulation, and feedback regulation. However, it is still unclear whether R-SMADs or Co-SMAD can feedback regulate the TGF-β family signaling pathways in granulosa cells (GCs). In this study, we report a novel mechanism underlying the feedback regulation of TGF-β family signaling pathways, i.e., SMAD4, the only Co-SMAD, positive feedback activates the TGF-β family signaling pathways in GCs with a basal level of TGF-β ligands by interacting with the core promoters of its upstream receptors. Mechanistically, SMAD4 acts as a transcription factor, and feedback activates the transcription of its upstream receptors, including <i>ACVR1B</i>, <i>BMPR2</i>, and <i>TGFBR2</i>, of the canonical TGF-β signaling pathways by interacting with three coactivators (c-JUN, CREB1, and SP1), respectively. Notably, three different interaction modes between SMAD4 and coactivators were identified in SMAD4-mediated feedback regulation of upstream receptors through reciprocal ChIP assays. Our findings in the present study indicate for the first time that SMAD4 feedback activates the canonical TGF-β family signaling pathways in GCs, which improves and expands the regulatory mechanism, especially the feedback regulation modes of TGF-β family signaling pathways in ovarian GCs.\n",

      "More and more evidences show that TGF-<i>β</i> has a crucial role in tumor initiation and development. However, the mechanism of the TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulator in esophageal cancer (EC) is still unclear. Here, we use a variety of bioinformatics methods to analyze the expression and survival data of TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulators in patients with EC. We extracted the expression of the S-TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulator from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The cBioPortal database was used to assess the frequency of genetic variation. The TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulator is expressed in EC and normal tissues. The objective is to use the Kaplan-Meier plotter database to investigate the prognostic value of TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulators in cancer patients. The DAVID and clusterProfiler software package were used for functional enrichment analysis. We found that patients with TGF-<i>β</i> signaling mutations have shorter overall survival, disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, platinum overall survival, and platinum-free progression survival. We found that compared with the noncancerous tissues of patients with EC, ZFYVE9, BMPR1B, TGFB3, TGFBRAP1, ACVRL1, TGFBR2, SMAD4, SMAD7, ACVR2A, BMPR1, and SMAD9 were significantly downregulated in tumor tissues, while ACVR1 and Smad1 were significantly upregulated in tumor samples. Univariate survival analysis showed that ACVR1, TGFBR3, TGFBRAP1, BMPR1A, SMAD4, and TGFBR2 were positively correlated with overall survival (OS) prolongation. In addition, TGF-<i>β</i> signal transduction regulators could be divided into two classes. Subclass 1 was involved in regulating cell adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, and Rap1 signaling. Subclass 2 was related to regulating angiogenesis and PI3K signaling. In short, all members of TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulators can be used as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of patients with EC.\n",

      "The transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway is deregulated in many diseases, including cancer. In healthy cells and early-stage cancer cells, this pathway has tumor-suppressor functions, including cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, its activation in late-stage cancer can promote tumorigenesis, including metastasis and chemoresistance. The dual function and pleiotropic nature of TGF-β signaling make it a challenging target and imply the need for careful therapeutic dosing of TGF-β drugs and patient selection. We review here the rationale for targeting TGF-β signaling in cancer and summarize the clinical status of pharmacological inhibitors. We discuss the direct effects of TGF-β signaling blockade on tumor and stromal cells, as well as biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of TGF-β inhibitors in cancer patients.\n",

      "Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and related growth factors are secreted pleiotropic factors that play critical roles in embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, death, and migration. The TGF-β family members signal via heteromeric complexes of type I and type II receptors, which activate members of the Smad family of signal transducers. The main attribute of the TGF-β signaling pathway is context-dependence. Depending on the concentration and type of ligand, target tissue, and developmental stage, TGF-β family members transmit distinct signals. Deregulation of TGF-β signaling contributes to developmental defects and human diseases. More than a decade of studies have revealed the framework by which TGF-βs encode a context-dependent signal, which includes various positive and negative modifiers of the principal elements of the signaling pathway, the receptors, and the Smad proteins. In this review, we first introduce some basic components of the TGF-β signaling pathways and their actions, and then discuss posttranslational modifications and modulatory partners that modify the outcome of the signaling and contribute to its context-dependence, including small noncoding RNAs.\n",

A conformational change induced upon binding GTP promotes an interaction with target (effector) proteins to generate a cellular response. A highly conserved function of Rho GTPases from yeast to humans is to control the actin cytoskeleton, although, in addition, they promote a wide range of other cellular activities.

      "The bones that comprise the axial skeleton have distinct morphological features characteristic of their positions along the anterior/posterior axis. We previously described a novel TGF-beta family member, myostatin (encoded by the gene Mstn, formerly Gdf8), that has an essential role in regulating skeletal muscle mass. We also identified a gene related to Mstn by low-stringency screening. While the work described here was being completed, the cloning of this gene, designated Gdf11 (also called Bmp11), was also reported by other groups. Here we show that Gdf11, a new transforming growth factor beta(TGFbeta) superfamily member, has an important role in establishing this skeletal pattern. During early mouse embryogenesis, Gdf11 is expressed in the primitive streak and tail bud regions, which are sites where new mesodermal cells are generated. Homozygous mutant mice carrying a targeted deletion of Gdf11 exhibit anteriorly directed homeotic transformations throughout the axial skeleton and posterior displacement of the hindlimbs. The effect of the mutation is dose dependent, as Gdf11+/- mice have a milder phenotype than Gdf11-/- mice. Mutant embryos show alterations in patterns of Hox gene expression, suggesting that Gdf11 acts upstream of the Hox genes. Our findings suggest that Gdf11 is a secreted signal that acts globally to specify positional identity along the anterior/posterior axis.\n",

      "GDF11, a new member of the TGF-beta gene superfamily, regulates anterior/posterior patterning in the axial skeleton during mouse embryogenesis. Gdf11 null mice display skeletal abnormalities that appear to represent anterior homeotic transformations of vertebrae consistent with high levels of Gdf11 expression in the primitive streak, presomitic mesoderm, and tail bud. However, despite strong Gdf11 expression in the limb throughout development, this structure does not appear to be affected in the knockout mice. In order to understand this dichotomy of Gdf11 expression versus Gdf11 function, we identified the chicken Gdf11 gene and studied its role during limb formation. In the early limb bud, Gdf11 transcripts are detected in the subectodermal mesoderm at the distal tip, in a region overlapping the progress zone. At these stages, Gdf11 is excluded from the central core mesenchyme where precartilaginous condensations will form. Later in development, Gdf11 continues to be expressed in the distal most mesenchyme and can also be detected more proximally, in between the forming skeletal elements. When beads incubated in GDF11 protein were implanted into the early wing bud, GDF11 caused severe truncations of the limb that affected both the cartilage elements and the muscle. Limb shortening appeared to be the result of an inhibition of chondrogenesis and myogenesis and using an in vitro micromass assay, we confirmed the negative effects of GDF11 on both myogenic and chondrogenic cell differentiation. Analysis of molecular markers of skeletal patterning revealed that GDF11 induced ectopic expression of Hoxd-11 and Hoxd-13, but not of Hoxa-11, Hoxa-13, or the Msx genes. These data suggest that GDF11 may be involved in controlling the late distal expression of the Hoxd genes during limb development and that misregulation of these Hox genes by excess GDF11 may cause some of the observed alterations in skeletal element shape. In addition, GDF11 induced the expression of its own antagonist follistatin, indicating that the activity of GFD11 may be limited by a negative feedback mechanism. The data from our studies in the chick suggest that Gdf11 plays a role in the formation and development of the avian limb skeleton.\n",

      "The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays a central role during vasculature development. Mutations or dysregulation of the BMP pathway members have been linked to arteriovenous malformations. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the BMP modulators bone morphogenetic protein endothelial precursor-derived regulator (BMPER) and twisted gastrulation protein homolog 1 (TWSG1) on arteriovenous specification during zebrafish development and analyzed downstream Notch signaling pathway in human endothelial cells. Silencing of bmper and twsg1b in zebrafish embryos by morpholinos resulted in a pronounced enhancement of venous ephrinB4a marker expression and concomitant dysregulated arterial ephrinb2a marker expression detected by in situ hybridization. As arteriovenous specification was disturbed, we assessed the impact of BMPER and TWSG1 protein stimulation on the Notch signaling pathway on endothelial cells from different origin. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis showed increased expression of Notch target gene hairy and enhancer of split, HEY1/2 and EPHRINB2. Consistently, silencing of BMPER in endothelial cells by siRNAs decreased Notch signaling and downstream effectors. BMP receptor antagonist DMH1 abolished BMPER and BMP4 induced Notch signaling pathway activation. In conclusion, we found that in endothelial cells, BMPER and TWSG1 are necessary for regular Notch signaling activity and in zebrafish embryos BMPER and TWSG1 preserve arteriovenous specification to prevent malformations.\n",

      "Twisted gastrulation (TWSG1), an extracellular regulator of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, is critical for embryonic brain development. Mice deficient in TWSG1 have abnormal forebrain development manifesting as holoprosencephaly. The expression and potential roles of TWSG1 in postnatal brain development are less well understood. We show that Twsg1 is expressed in the adult mouse brain in the choroid plexus (CP), hippocampus, and other regions, with the strongest expression observed in CP. TWSG1 was also detected in a human fetal brain at mid-gestation, with highest levels in the epithelium of CP. Bmp1, Bmp2, Bmp4-Bmp7 as well as BmprIA and BmprII, but not BmprIB, were expressed in CP. BMP antagonists Chordin (Chrd) and Noggin were not detected in CP, however Chrd-like 1 and brain-specific Chrd-like (Brorin) were expressed. Electrophysiological study of synaptic plasticity revealed normal paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of hippocampus in Twsg1(-/-) mice. Among the homozygous mutants that survive beyond the first 2 weeks, the prevalence of hydrocephalus was 4.3%, compared to 1.5% in a wild type colony (P=0.0133) between 3 and 10 weeks of life. We detected a high level of BMP signaling in CP in wild type adult mice that was 17-fold higher than in the hippocampus (P=0.005). In contrast, transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling was predominant in the hippocampus. Both BMP signaling and the expression of BMP downstream targets Msx1 and Msx2 were reduced in CP in Twsg1(-/-) mice. In summary, we show that Twsg1 is expressed in the adult mouse and human fetal CP. We also show that BMP is a branch of TGFbeta superfamily that is dominant in CP. This presents an interesting avenue for future research in light of the novel roles of CP in neural progenitor differentiation and neuronal repair, especially since TWSG1 appears to be the main regulator of BMP present in CP.\n",

      "Gastric cancer has a high incidence and mortality in the world, especially in China. The pathogenesis leading to the high heterogeneity of gastric cancer remains unclear. It is believed that TWSG1 is associated with a variety of tumors, but there are few studies related to gastric cancer. To investigate the biological significance of TWSG1, we evaluated the TWSG1 expression of the clinical samples and gastric cancer cell lines (BGC-823, MGC-803, and SGC-790) via stomach cancer tissue array, real-time PCR, and western blotting. Then, we used CCK-8 and flow cytometry to detect the function and mechanism of TWSG1 in gastric cell lines. The analysis showed that TWSG1 showed decreased expression in clinical samples and BGC-823, MGC-803, and SGC-7901 cells. And, overexpressed TWSG1 inhibited the cell cycle and proliferation, TWSG1 might influence the proliferation of SGC-7901 and MGC-803 by regulating the BMP signaling. However, the influence of TWSG1 on BGC-823 cell is not associated with the BMP signaling. In conclusion, all of our findings revealed that TWSG1 maybe serves as a tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer and potential biomarker or therapeutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.\n",

      "TGF-β family signaling pathways, including TGF-β and BMP pathways, are widely involved in the regulation of health and diseases through downstream SMADs, which are also regulated by multiple validated mechanisms, such as genetic regulation, epigenetic regulation, and feedback regulation. However, it is still unclear whether R-SMADs or Co-SMAD can feedback regulate the TGF-β family signaling pathways in granulosa cells (GCs). In this study, we report a novel mechanism underlying the feedback regulation of TGF-β family signaling pathways, i.e., SMAD4, the only Co-SMAD, positive feedback activates the TGF-β family signaling pathways in GCs with a basal level of TGF-β ligands by interacting with the core promoters of its upstream receptors. Mechanistically, SMAD4 acts as a transcription factor, and feedback activates the transcription of its upstream receptors, including <i>ACVR1B</i>, <i>BMPR2</i>, and <i>TGFBR2</i>, of the canonical TGF-β signaling pathways by interacting with three coactivators (c-JUN, CREB1, and SP1), respectively. Notably, three different interaction modes between SMAD4 and coactivators were identified in SMAD4-mediated feedback regulation of upstream receptors through reciprocal ChIP assays. Our findings in the present study indicate for the first time that SMAD4 feedback activates the canonical TGF-β family signaling pathways in GCs, which improves and expands the regulatory mechanism, especially the feedback regulation modes of TGF-β family signaling pathways in ovarian GCs.\n",

      "More and more evidences show that TGF-<i>β</i> has a crucial role in tumor initiation and development. However, the mechanism of the TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulator in esophageal cancer (EC) is still unclear. Here, we use a variety of bioinformatics methods to analyze the expression and survival data of TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulators in patients with EC. We extracted the expression of the S-TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulator from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The cBioPortal database was used to assess the frequency of genetic variation. The TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulator is expressed in EC and normal tissues. The objective is to use the Kaplan-Meier plotter database to investigate the prognostic value of TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulators in cancer patients. The DAVID and clusterProfiler software package were used for functional enrichment analysis. We found that patients with TGF-<i>β</i> signaling mutations have shorter overall survival, disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, platinum overall survival, and platinum-free progression survival. We found that compared with the noncancerous tissues of patients with EC, ZFYVE9, BMPR1B, TGFB3, TGFBRAP1, ACVRL1, TGFBR2, SMAD4, SMAD7, ACVR2A, BMPR1, and SMAD9 were significantly downregulated in tumor tissues, while ACVR1 and Smad1 were significantly upregulated in tumor samples. Univariate survival analysis showed that ACVR1, TGFBR3, TGFBRAP1, BMPR1A, SMAD4, and TGFBR2 were positively correlated with overall survival (OS) prolongation. In addition, TGF-<i>β</i> signal transduction regulators could be divided into two classes. Subclass 1 was involved in regulating cell adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, and Rap1 signaling. Subclass 2 was related to regulating angiogenesis and PI3K signaling. In short, all members of TGF-<i>β</i> signal regulators can be used as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of patients with EC.\n",

      "MBD5 and MBD6 are two members of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins that are poorly characterized. Studies performed thus far have failed to show binding of the MBD5 and MBD6 MBD to methylated DNA. Here, we show that both MBD5 and MBD6 interact with the mammalian PR-DUB Polycomb protein complex in a mutually exclusive manner. Strikingly, the MBD of MBD5 and MBD6 is both necessary and sufficient to mediate this interaction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal that MBD6 and FOXK2/PR-DUB share a subset of genomic target genes, suggesting a functional interaction in vivo. Finally, we show that MBD6, but not MBD5, is recruited to sites of DNA damage in a PR-DUB independent manner. Our study thus implies a shared function for MBD5 and MBD6 through an interaction with PR-DUB, as well as an MBD6-specific recruitment to sites of DNA damage.\n",

      "Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is a pivotal regulator of cell fate in adult stem cells. Its expression is significantly downregulated in late passages of cells, concomitant with a prominent increase in Ago2 cytosolic localization in single cells. Nuclear localization of Ago2 is crucial for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hATSCs (human adipose tissue-derived stem cells), mediated by the specific binding of the regulatory regions of functional genes, which positively or negatively altered gene expression. Ago2 targets genes that control stemness, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and microRNA expression, all of which are crucial for hATSC survival and self-renewal. Ago2 promotes cell proliferation and self-renewal by activating the expression of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4). We confirmed the direct regulation of Oct4 activity by Ago2, as indicated by the results of the ChIP analysis. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 6 (MBD6) was detected as an Oct4 regulatory gene. As predicted, knockdown of MBD6 expression attenuated cell proliferation and eventually induced cell death. We hypothesized that MBD6 functions downstream of Oct4 in the regulation of stemness-related genes, cell proliferation, self-renewal activity, and survival. MBD6 also promoted cell transdifferentiation into neural and endodermal β-cells while significantly attenuating differentiation into the mesodermal lineage. We demonstrate that MBD6 is regulated by Ago2 via an interaction with Oct4, which alters self-renewal and gene expression in hATSCs. MBD6 was promoted cell proliferation through a novel set of signal mediators that may influence differentiation by repressing MBD2 and MBD3, which are possibly recruited by germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF).\n",

      "DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that acts on cytosine residues. The methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBD) are involved in the recognition of methyl-cytosines by activating a signaling cascade that induces the formation of heterochromatin or euchromatin, thereby regulating gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the evolution and conservation of MBD proteins in plants. First, we performed a genome-wide identification and analysis of the MBD family in common bean and soybean, since they have experienced one and two whole-genome duplication events, respectively. We found one pair of MBD paralogs in soybean (GmMBD2) has subfunctionalized after their recent divergence, which was corroborated with their expression profile. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that classes of MBD proteins clustered with human MBD. Interestingly, the MBD9 may have emerged after the hexaploidization event in eudicots. We found that plants and humans share a great similarity in MBDs' binding affinity in the mCpG context. MBD2 and MBD4 from different plant species have the conserved four amino acid residues -Arg (R), Asp (D), Tyr (Y) and Arg (R)- reported to be responsible for MBD-binding in the mCpG. However, MBD8, MBD9, MBD10, and MBD11 underwent substitutions in these residues, suggesting the non-interaction in the mCpG context, but a heterochromatin association as MBD5 and MBD6 from human. This study represents the first genome-wide analysis of the MBD gene family in eurosids I - soybean and common bean. The data presented here contribute towards understanding the evolution of MBDs proteins in plants and their specific binding affinity on mCpG site.\n",

      "Protein-protein interaction cascades are crucial for cellular signaling pathways and cell morphogenesis. Membrane traffic along the secretory and endocytic pathways is similarly governed by regulated protein-protein interactions of diverse machineries, which are inter-regulated, assembled and disassembled sequentially to drive membrane budding, vesicle transport, membrane fission and fusion. Rab7, the key regulator in endo-lysosomal trafficking investigated extensively in the past decades, is emerging to govern early-to-late endosomal maturation, microtubule minus-end as well as plus-end directed endosomal migration and positioning, and endosome-lysosome transport through different protein-protein interaction cascades. We summarize here the key protein interaction cascades of Rab7 by focusing on endo-lysosomal trafficking regulated by its interaction with HOPs, RILP, ORP1L, FYCO1 and Mon1/Sand1-CCZ1 complex.\n",

      "Lysosomal degradation of signalling receptors such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is an important mechanism for termination of cell signalling. Such degradation involves the endosomal sorting of ubiquitylated receptors into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) that move along microtubules to fuse with perinuclear lysosomes. The Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein RILP is interesting in this context as it interacts with Vps22 (also known as EAP30) and Vps36 (also known as EAP45), subunits of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport II (ESCRT-II), as well as with the dynein-dynactin motor complex. Because previous functional studies of RILP have been based on its overexpression, we have asked here whether RILP is required for endocytic trafficking of receptors. Depletion of RILP caused elevated levels of four late-endosomal molecules, lyso-bisphosphatidic acid, Lamp1, CD63 and cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Electron microscopy showed that endosomes of RILP-depleted cells were morphologically distinct from normal late endosomes and had a strongly reduced content of ILVs. As in Vps22-depleted cells, ligand-mediated degradation of EGFRs was strongly inhibited in RILP-depleted cells, in which endocytosed EGFRs were found to accumulate in early endosomes. By contrast, endocytosis and recycling of transferrin receptors occurred normally in RILP-depleted cells. These results establish that RILP, like the ESCRT proteins, is required for biogenesis of MVEs and degradative trafficking of EGFRs but not for trafficking of transferrin receptors through early endosomes. We propose that RILP might coordinate the biogenesis of MVEs with dynein-mediated motility.\n",

      "The small GTPase Rab7 is a key organizer of receptor sorting and lysosomal degradation by recruiting of a variety of effectors depending on its GDP/GTP-bound state. However, molecular mechanisms that trigger Rab7 inactivation remain elusive. Here we find that, among the endosomal pools, Rab7-positive compartments possess the highest level of PI4P, which is primarily produced by PI4K2A kinase. Acute conversion of this endosomal PI4P to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> causes Rab7 dissociation from late endosomes and releases a regulator of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, PLEKHM1, from the membrane. Rab7 effectors Vps35 and RILP are not affected by acute PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production. Deletion of PI4K2A greatly reduces PIP5Kγ-mediated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production in Rab7-positive endosomes leading to impaired Rab7 inactivation and increased number of LC3-positive structures with defective autophagosome-lysosome fusion. These results reveal a late endosomal PI4P-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -dependent regulatory loop that impacts autophagosome flux by affecting Rab7 cycling and PLEKHM1 association.\n",

      "The identification of novel cancer-related and immunogenic proteins is still a challenge to be faced to improve antigen-specific tumor immunotherapy. The category of so-called cancer-testis (CT) antigens is one of the most perspective groups of proteins for anticancer immune response activation as normally they are expressed in immunoprivileged tissues and are immunogenic if aberrantly generated in tumors. The heterogeneous group of proteins called sperm-associated antigens (SPAG) might encompass novel CT antigens owing to their common expression in male germ cells, their ability to elicit immune response underlying infertility, and lately proposed oncogenic properties. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the expression pattern in various normal and cancerous tissues and assessed the frequency of spontaneous humoral immune response against members of the SPAG group in cancer patients using phage-displayed antigen microarrays. Our results show that out of 15 analyzed SPAG genes only SPAG1, SPAG6, SPAG8, SPAG15, and SPAG17 are predominantly expressed in testis, whereas the others are ubiquitously expressed with only a testis-associated alternative splice variant of SPAG16. mRNA expression of SPAG1, SPAG6, and alternative splice variants of SPAG8, SPAG16, and SPAG17 was elevated in various tumors with frequencies ranging from approximately 10% to 70%. The upregulation of SPAG6 in lung and breast cancer was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of tumor and normal tissue microarrays. Cancer-associated spontaneous humoral immune response was detected against SPAG1, SPAG6, SPAG8, and a novel testis-specific splice variant of SPAG17 and ascribe these as novel CT antigens that potentially are applicable as immunotherapeutic targets and serologic biomarkers.\n",

      "The mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a crucial role in regulation of cell survival, metabolism, growth and protein synthesis in response to upstream signals in both normal physiological and pathological conditions, especially in cancer. Aberrant mTOR signaling resulting from genetic alterations from different levels of the signal cascade is commonly observed in various types of cancers. Upon hyperactivation, mTOR signaling promotes cell proliferation and metabolism that contribute to tumor initiation and progression. In addition, mTOR also negatively regulates autophagy via different ways. We discuss mTOR signaling and its key upstream and downstream factors, the specific genetic changes in the mTOR pathway and the inhibitors of mTOR applied as therapeutic strategies in eight solid tumors. Although monotherapy and combination therapy with mTOR inhibitors have been extensively applied in preclinical and clinical trials in various cancer types, innovative therapies with better efficacy and less drug resistance are still in great need, and new biomarkers and deep sequencing technologies will facilitate these mTOR targeting drugs benefit the cancer patients in personalized therapy.\n",

      "Oncogenic activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a frequent event in prostate cancer that facilitates tumor formation, disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Recent discoveries indicate that the complex crosstalk between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and multiple interacting cell signaling cascades can further promote prostate cancer progression and influence the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PI3K-AKT-mTOR-targeted therapies being explored in the clinic, as well as standard treatment approaches such as androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). However, the full extent of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network during prostate tumorigenesis, invasive progression and disease recurrence remains to be determined. In this review, we outline the emerging diversity of the genetic alterations that lead to activated PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in prostate cancer, and discuss new mechanistic insights into the interplay between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and several key interacting oncogenic signaling cascades that can cooperate to facilitate prostate cancer growth and drug-resistance, specifically the androgen receptor (AR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and WNT signaling cascades. Ultimately, deepening our understanding of the broader PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network is crucial to aid patient stratification for PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-directed therapies, and to discover new therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer that improve patient outcome.\n",

      "Apigenin is a dietary flavonoid with known antioxidant and antitumor effects against several types of cancers by promoting cell death and inducing cell cycle arrest. Apigenin also regulates a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways during apoptosis or autophagy. However, the precise mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of apigenin in liver cancer remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that apigenin has anticancer activity against hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Apigenin inhibited the cell growth and induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. We found that apigenin treatment increased the expression of LC3-II and the number of GFP-LC3 puncta. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA and Atg5 gene silencing strengthened apigenin-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. Our data has indicated that apigenin-induced autophagy has a protective effect against cell death. Additionally, apigenin induced apoptosis and autophagy through inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Most importantly, in vivo data showed that administration of apigenin decreased tumor growth and autophagy inhibition by 3-MA significantly enhanced the anticancer effect of apigenin. Collectively, our results reveal that apigenin inhibits cell proliferation and induces autophagy via suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our results also suggest combination of autophagy inhibitors and apigenin would be a potential chemotherapeutic strategy against hepatocellular carcinoma.\n",

These proteins were found to play crucial roles in the regulation of immune homeostasis, inflammation, and cancer development. Intensive research in the past two decades revealed a strong correlation of TIPE proteins with the development of various cancers including cancers of the bladder, blood, bone, breast, cervix, colon, esophagus, endometrium, stomach, liver, lung, ovary, pancreas, prostate, and thyroid gland. Also, deregulation of these proteins was found to promote the essential hallmarks of cancer such as survival, tumor growth, proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, migration, and metastasis. Further, differential expression of these proteins in normal and cancer tissues and their association with tumor progression and prognosis signifies the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of TIPE proteins and their importance in cancer therapy. The current review summarizes the literature available thus far on the expression, function, and role of TIPE proteins in the development and maintenance of various cancers.\n",

      "The tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like (TIPE/TNFAIP8) family is a recently identified family of proteins that is strongly associated with the regulation of immunity and tumorigenesis. This family is comprised of four members, namely, tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 (TIPE/TNFAIP8), tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 1 (TIPE1/TNFAIP8L1), tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2/TNFAIP8L2), and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 3 (TIPE3/TNFAIP8L3). Although the proteins of this family were initially described as regulators of tumorigenesis, inflammation, and cell death, they are also found to be involved in the regulation of autophagy and the transfer of lipid secondary messengers, besides contributing to immune function and homeostasis. Interestingly, despite the existence of a significant sequence homology among the four members of this family, they are involved in different biological activities and also exhibit remarkable variability of expression. Furthermore, this family of proteins is highly deregulated in different human cancers and various chronic diseases. This review summarizes the vivid role of the TIPE family of proteins and its association with various signaling cascades in diverse chronic diseases.\n",

      "Dystonia type 1 (DYT1) is a dominantly inherited neurological disease caused by mutations in TOR1A, the gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein torsinA. Previous work mostly completed in cell-based systems suggests that mutant torsinA alters protein processing in the secretory pathway. We hypothesized that inducing ER stress in the mammalian brain in vivo would trigger or exacerbate mutant torsinA-induced dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we crossed DYT1 knock-in with p58(IPK)-null mice. The ER co-chaperone p58(IPK) interacts with BiP and assists in protein maturation by helping to fold ER cargo. Its deletion increases the cellular sensitivity to ER stress. We found a lower generation of DYT1 knock-in/p58 knock-out mice than expected from this cross, suggesting a developmental interaction that influences viability. However, surviving animals did not exhibit abnormal motor function. Analysis of brain tissue uncovered dysregulation of eiF2α and Akt/mTOR translational control pathways in the DYT1 brain, a finding confirmed in a second rodent model and in human brain. Finally, an unbiased proteomic analysis identified relevant changes in the neuronal protein landscape suggesting abnormal ER protein metabolism and calcium dysregulation. Functional studies confirmed the interaction between the DYT1 genotype and neuronal calcium dynamics. Overall, these findings advance our knowledge on dystonia, linking translational control pathways and calcium physiology to dystonia pathogenesis and identifying potential new pharmacological targets.\n",
      "Dystonia type 1 (DYT1) is one of the different forms of inherited dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, disabling movements. DYT1 is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein torsinA. How mutant torsinA causes neuronal dysfunction remains unknown. Here, we show the behavioral and molecular consequences of stressing the ER in DYT1 mice by increasing the amount of misfolded proteins. This resulted in the generation of a reduced number of animals, evidence of abnormal ER protein processing and dysregulation of translational control pathways. The work described here proposes a shared mechanism for different forms of dystonia, links for the first time known biological pathways to dystonia pathogenesis, and uncovers potential pharmacological targets for its treatment.\n",

      "A three-nucleotide (GAG) deletion (ΔE) in TorsinA (TOR1A) has been identified as the most common cause of dominantly inherited early-onset torsion dystonia (DYT1). TOR1A encodes a chaperone-like AAA+-protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Currently, only three additional, likely mutations have been reported in single dystonia patients. Here, we report two new, putative TOR1A mutations (p.A14_P15del and p.E121K) that we examined functionally in comparison with wild-type (WT) protein and two known mutations (ΔE and p.R288Q). While inclusion formation is a characteristic feature for ΔE TOR1A, elevated levels of aggregates for other mutations were not observed when compared with WT TOR1A. WT and mutant TOR1A showed preferred degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which is most pronounced for p.A14_P15del, p.R288Q, and ΔE TOR1A. Notably, blocking of the autophagy pathway with bafilomycin resulted in a significant increase in inclusion formation in p.E121K TOR1A. In addition, all variants had an influence on protein stability. Although the p.A14_P15del mutation affects the proposed oligomerization domain of TOR1A, this mutation did not disturb the ability to dimerize. Our findings demonstrate functional changes for all four mutations on different levels. Thus, both diagnostic and research genetic screening of dystonia patients should not be limited to testing for the ∆E mutation.\n",

      "See Ginevrino and Valente (doi:10.1093/brain/awx260) for a scientific commentary on this article. Autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1 is a disease with incomplete penetrance most often caused by an in-frame GAG deletion (p.Glu303del) in the endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein torsinA encoded by TOR1A. We report an association of the homozygous dominant disease-causing TOR1A p.Glu303del mutation, and a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly318Ser) with a severe arthrogryposis phenotype with developmental delay, strabismus and tremor in three unrelated Iranian families. All parents who were carriers of the TOR1A variant showed no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs, indicating decreased penetrance similar to families with autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1. The results from cell assays demonstrate that the p.Gly318Ser substitution causes a redistribution of torsinA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope, similar to the hallmark of the p.Glu303del mutation. Our study highlights that TOR1A mutations should be considered in patients with severe arthrogryposis and further expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with TOR1A mutations.\n",

      "TLR-mediated signaling pathways play critical roles in host defense against microbials. However, dysregulation of innate immune and inflammatory responses triggered by TLRs would result in harmful damage to the host. Using a <i>Trim8</i> gene-knockout mouse model, we show that tripartite motif (TRIM) 8 negatively regulates TLR3- and TLR4-mediated innate immune and inflammatory responses. TRIM8 deficiency leads to increased polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid- and LPS-triggered induction of downstream anti-microbial genes including <i>TNF</i>, <i>Il6</i>, <i>Rantes</i>, and <i>Ifnb</i>, evaluated serum cytokine levels, and increased susceptibility of mice to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid- and LPS-induced inflammatory death as well as <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> infection-induced loss of body weight and septic shock. TRIM8 interacted with Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-β and mediated its K6- and K33-linked polyubiquitination, leading to disruption of the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-β-TANK-binding kinase-1 association. Our findings uncover an additional mechanism on the termination of TLR3/4-mediated inflammatory and innate immune responses.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "TRIM8 plays a key role in controlling the p53 molecular switch that sustains the transcriptional activation of cell cycle arrest genes and response to chemotherapeutic drugs. The mechanisms that regulate TRIM8, especially in cancers like clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) where it is low expressed, are still unknown. However, recent studies suggest the potential involvement of some microRNAs belonging to miR-17-92 and its paralogous clusters, which could include TRIM8 in a more complex pathway.\n",
      "We used RCC and CRC cell models for in-vitro experiments, and ccRCC patients and xenograft transplanted mice for in vivo assessments. To measure microRNAs levels we performed RT-qPCR, while steady-states of TRIM8, p53, p21 and N-MYC were quantified at protein level by Western Blotting as well as at transcript level by RT-qPCR. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess the interaction between TRIM8 and specific miRNAs, and the potential effects of this interaction on TRIM8 expression. Moreover, we treated our cell models with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and measured their response in terms of cell proliferation by MTT and colony suppression assays.\n",
      "We showed that TRIM8 is a target of miR-17-5p and miR-106b-5p, whose expression is promoted by N-MYC, and that alterations of their levels affect cell proliferation, acting on the TRIM8 transcripts stability, as confirmed in ccRCC patients and cell lines. In addition, reducing the levels of miR-17-5p/miR-106b-5p, we increased the chemo-sensitivity of RCC/CRC-derived cells to anti-tumour drugs used in the clinic. Intriguingly, this occurs, on one hand, by recovering the p53 tumour suppressor activity in a TRIM8-dependent fashion and, on the other hand, by promoting the transcription of miR-34a that turns off the oncogenic action of N-MYC. This ultimately leads to cell proliferation reduction or block, observed also in colon cancer xenografts overexpressing TRIM8.\n",
      "In this paper we provided evidence that TRIM8 and its regulators miR-17-5p and miR-106b-5 participate to a feedback loop controlling cell proliferation through the reciprocal modulation of p53, miR-34a and N-MYC. Our experiments pointed out that this axis is pivotal in defining drug responsiveness of cancers such ccRCC and CRC.\n",

      "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant form of primary brain tumor, and GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) contribute to the rapid growth, therapeutic resistance, and clinical recurrence of these fatal tumors. STAT3 signaling supports the maintenance and proliferation of GSCs, yet regulatory mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we report that tri-partite motif-containing protein 8 (TRIM8) activates STAT3 signaling to maintain stemness and self-renewing capabilities of GSCs. TRIM8 (also known as 'glioblastoma-expressed ring finger protein') is expressed equally in GBM and normal brain tissues, despite its hemizygous deletion in the large majority of GBMs, and its expression is highly correlated with stem cell markers. Experimental knockdown of TRIM8 reduced GSC self-renewal and expression of SOX2, NESTIN, and p-STAT3, and promoted glial differentiation. Overexpression of TRIM8 led to higher expression of p-STAT3, c-MYC, SOX2, NESTIN, and CD133, and enhanced GSC self-renewal. We found that TRIM8 activates STAT3 by suppressing the expression of PIAS3, an inhibitor of STAT3, most likely through E3-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, we also found that STAT3 activation upregulates TRIM8, providing a mechanism for normalized TRIM8 expression in the setting of hemizygous gene deletion. These data demonstrate that bidirectional TRIM8-STAT3 signaling regulates stemness in GSC.\n",

      "Inflammation and apoptosis are two important pathological causes of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). The crosstalk between these two biological processes during IDD pathogenesis remains elusive. Herein, we discovered that chronic inflammation induced apoptosis through a cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL)-dependent mechanism. Two cullin proteins, CUL4A and 4B, recruited DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), RING-box protein 1 (RBX1) and DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 6 (DCAF6) to assemble a CRL4<sup>DCAF6</sup> E3 ligase in intervertebral discs (IVDs) derived from IDD patients. The CRL4<sup>DCAF6</sup> E3 ligase ubiquitinated and degraded C-terminal-binding protein 1 and 2 (CtBP1/2), two homologues of transcriptional corepressors. The degradation of CtBP1/2 disassociated from the p300-forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) complex, inducing the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)-binding component 3 (BBC3) and causing BBC3-dependent apoptosis. TSC01131, a small molecule that specifically targets CUL4-DDB1 interaction, could inhibit the ubiquitination of CtBP1/2 in vitro and in vivo, thereby decreasing the BBC3 expression level and preventing apoptosis signalling. Using a mouse chronic inflammation model, we found that chronic inflammation could accelerate the IDD process through a conserved CRL4<sup>DCAF6</sup>-mediated mechanism. The administration of TSC01131 to mice could significantly improve the outcome of IDD. Collectively, our results revealed that inflammation-dependent CRL4<sup>DCAF6</sup> E3 ligase triggered apoptosis through the removal of CtBP-mediated transrepression. The blockage of the CRL4<sup>DCAF6</sup> E3 ligase by TSC01131 may represent a new therapeutic strategy for IDD treatment. KEY MESSAGES: CUL4A and CUL4B recruited DDB1, RBX1 and DCAF6 to assemble a CRL4<sup>DCAF6</sup> E3 ligase in human IDD biopsies. The CRL4<sup>DCAF6</sup> E3 ligase ubiquitinated and degraded CtBP1/2, causing BBC3-dependent apoptosis. A small molecule TSC01131 that specifically targets CUL4-DDB1 interaction could inhibit the ubiquitination of CtBP1/2, improving the outcome of IDD in a mouse model.\n",

      "Cullin proteins are molecular scaffolds that have crucial roles in the post-translational modification of cellular proteins involving ubiquitin. The mammalian cullin protein family comprises eight members (CUL1 to CUL7 and PARC), which are characterized by a cullin homology domain. CUL1 to CUL7 assemble multi-subunit Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, the largest family of E3 ligases with more than 200 members. Although CUL7 and PARC are present only in chordates, other members of the cullin protein family are found in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana and yeast. A cullin protein tethers both a substrate-targeting unit, often through an adaptor protein, and the RING finger component in a CRL. The cullin-organized CRL thus positions a substrate close to the RING-bound E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate. In addition, conjugation of cullins with the ubiquitin-like molecule Nedd8 modulates activation of the corresponding CRL complex, probably through conformational regulation of the interactions between cullin's carboxy-terminal tail and CRL's RING subunit. Genetic studies in several model organisms have helped to unravel a multitude of physiological functions associated with cullin proteins and their respective CRLs. CRLs target numerous substrates and thus have an impact on a range of biological processes, including cell growth, development, signal transduction, transcriptional control, genomic integrity and tumor suppression. Moreover, mutations in CUL7 and CUL4B genes have been linked to hereditary human diseases.\n",

      "Ligand-dependent protein degradation has emerged as a compelling strategy to pharmacologically control the protein content of cells. So far, however, only a limited number of E3 ligases have been found to support this process. Here, we use a chemical proteomic strategy that leverages broadly reactive, cysteine-directed electrophilic fragments coupled to selective ligands for intracellular proteins (for example, SLF for FKBP12, JQ1 for BRD4) to screen for heterobifunctional degrader compounds (or proteolysis targeting chimeras, PROTACs) that operate by covalent adduction of E3 ligases. This approach identified DCAF16-a poorly characterized substrate recognition component of CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligases-as a target of electrophilic PROTACs that promote the nuclear-restricted degradation of proteins. We find that only a modest fraction (~10-40%) of DCAF16 needs to be modified to support protein degradation, pointing to the potential for electrophilic PROTACs to induce neosubstrate degradation without substantially perturbing the function of the participating E3 ligase.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "p53 has been studied intensively as a major tumour suppressor that detects oncogenic events in cancer cells and eliminates them through senescence (a permanent non-proliferative state) or apoptosis. Consistent with this role, p53 activity is compromised in a high proportion of all cancer types, either through mutation of the TP53 gene (encoding p53) or changes in the status of p53 modulators. p53 has additional roles, which may overlap with its tumour-suppressive capacity, in processes including the DNA damage response, metabolism, aging, stem cell differentiation and fertility. Moreover, many mutant p53 proteins, termed 'gain-of-function' (GOF), acquire new activities that help drive cancer aggression. p53 is regulated mainly through protein turnover and operates within a negative-feedback loop with its transcriptional target, MDM2 (murine double minute 2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase which mediates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of p53. Induction of p53 is achieved largely through uncoupling the p53-MDM2 interaction, leading to elevated p53 levels. Various stress stimuli acting on p53 (such as hyperproliferation and DNA damage) use different, but overlapping, mechanisms to achieve this. Additionally, p53 activity is regulated through critical context-specific or fine-tuning events, mediated primarily through post-translational mechanisms, particularly multi-site phosphorylation and acetylation. In the present review, I broadly examine these events, highlighting their regulatory contributions, their ability to integrate signals from cellular events towards providing most appropriate response to stress conditions and their importance for tumour suppression. These are fascinating aspects of molecular oncology that hold the key to understanding the molecular pathology of cancer and the routes by which it may be tackled therapeutically.\n",

      "The TP53 gene is well known to be the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. In addition to mutations, there are > 20 different coding region single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TP53 gene, as well as SNPs in MDM2, the negative regulator of p53. Several of these SNPs are known to alter p53 pathway function. This makes p53 rather unique among cancer-critical genes, e.g. the coding regions of other cancer-critical genes like Ha-Ras, RB, and PI3KCA do not have non-synonymous coding region SNPs that alter their function in cancer. The next frontier in p53 biology will consist of probing which of these coding region SNPs are moderately or strongly pathogenic and whether they influence cancer risk and the efficacy of cancer therapy. The challenge after that will consist of determining whether we can tailor chemotherapy to correct the defects for each of these variants. Here we review the SNPs in TP53 and MDM2 that show the most significant impact on cancer and other diseases. We also propose avenues for how this information can be used to better inform personalized medicine approaches to cancer and other diseases.\n",

      "MDM2 protein is the core negative regulator of p53 that maintains the cellular levels of p53 at a low level in normal cells. Mutation of the TP53 gene accounts for 50% of all human cancers. In the remaining malignancies with wild-type TP53, p53 function is inhibited through other mechanisms. Recently, synthetic small molecule inhibitors have been developed which target a small hydrophobic pocket on MDM2 to which p53 normally binds. Given that MDM2-p53 antagonists have been undergoing clinical trials for different types of cancer, this review illustrates different aspects of these new cancer targeted therapeutic agents with the focus on the major advances in the field. It emphasizes on the p53 function, regulation of p53, targeting of the p53-MDM2 interaction for cancer therapy, and p53-dependent and -independent effects of inhibition of p53-MDM2 interaction. Then, representatives of small molecule MDM2-p53 binding antagonists are introduced with a focus on those entered into clinical trials. Furthermore, the review discusses the gene signatures in order to predict sensitivity to MDM2 antagonists, potential side effects and the reasons for the observed hematotoxicity, mechanisms of resistance to these drugs, their evaluation as monotherapy or in combination with conventional chemotherapy or with other targeted therapeutic agents. Finally, it highlights the certainly intriguing questions and challenges which would be addressed in future studies.\n",

      "Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance, but the mechanisms regulating the stability and function of Treg cells have not been fully elucidated. Here we show SUMO-specific protease 3 (SENP3) is a pivotal regulator of Treg cells that functions by controlling the SUMOylation and nuclear localization of BACH2. Treg cell-specific deletion of Senp3 results in T cell activation, autoimmune symptoms and enhanced antitumor T cell responses. SENP3-mediated BACH2 deSUMOylation prevents the nuclear export of BACH2, thereby repressing the genes associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T effector cell differentiation and stabilizing Treg cell-specific gene signatures. Notably, SENP3 accumulation triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in Treg cell-mediated tumor immunosuppression. Our results not only establish the role of SENP3 in the maintenance of Treg cell stability and function via BACH2 deSUMOylation but also clarify the function of SENP3 in the regulation of ROS-induced immune tolerance.\n",

      "The roles of SUMOylation and the related enzymes in autophagic regulation are unclear. Based on our previous studies that identified the SUMO2/3-specific peptidase SENP3 as an oxidative stress-responsive molecule, we investigated the correlation between SUMOylation and macroautophagy/autophagy. We found that <i>Senp3<sup>±</sup></i> mice showed increased autophagy in the liver under basal and fasting conditions, compared to <i>Senp3<sup>+/+</sup></i> mice. We constructed a liver-specific <i>senp3</i> knockout mouse; these <i>Senp3</i>-deficient liver tissues showed increased autophagy as well. Autophagic flux was accelerated in hepatic and other cell lines following knockdown of <i>SENP3</i>, both before and after the cells underwent starvation in the form of the serum and amino acid deprivation. We demonstrated that BECN1/beclin 1, the core molecule of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex, could be SUMO3-conjugated by PIAS3 predominantly at K380 and deSUMOylated by SENP3. The basal SUMOylation of BECN1 was increased upon cellular starvation, which enhanced autophagosome formation by facilitating BECN1 interaction with other complex components UVRAG, PIK3C3 and ATG14, thus promoting PIK3C3 activity. In contrast, SENP3 deSUMOylated BECN1, which impaired BECN1-PIK3C3 complex formation or stability to suppress the PIK3C3 activity. DeSUMOylation of BECN1 restrained autophagy induction under basal conditions and especially upon starvation when SENP3 had accumulated in response to the increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, while reversible SUMOylation regulated the degree of autophagy, SENP3 provided an intrinsic overflow valve for fine-tuning autophagy induction.\n",

      "The ubiquitin-like SUMO system regulates gene expression, but the molecular insights into this process are incomplete. We show that the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP3 controls H3K4 methylation by regulating histone-modifying SET1/MLL complexes. SET1/MLL complexes are composed of a histone methyltransferase and the regulatory components WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30. MLL1/MLL2 complexes contain menin as additional component and are particularly important for the activation of HOX genes. We demonstrate that SENP3 is associated with MLL1/MLL2 complexes and catalyzes deSUMOylation of RbBP5. This is required for activation of a subset of HOX genes, including the developmental regulator DLX3. In the absence of SENP3, the association of menin and Ash2L with the DLX3 gene is impaired, leading to decreased H3K4 methylation and reduced recruitment of active RNA polymerase II. Importantly, the SENP3-DLX3 pathway dictates osteogenic differentiation of human stem cells, thus delineating the importance of balanced SUMOylation for epigenetic control of gene expression programs.\n",

Hsp90α is regulated differently and has different functions when compared to the constitutively expressed Hsp90β isoform, despite high amino acid sequence identity between the two proteins. These differences are likely due to variations in nucleotide sequence within non-coding regions, which allows for specific regulation through interaction with particular transcription factors, and to subtle changes in amino acid sequence that allow for unique post-translational modifications. This article will specifically focus on the expression, function and regulation of Hsp90α.\n",

      "The pathological remodeling heart shows an increase in left ventricular mass and an excess of extracellular matrix deposition that can over time cause heart failure. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is the main cytokine controlling this process. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been shown to play a critical role in TGFβ signaling by stabilizing the TGFβ signaling cascade. We detected extracellular Hsp90 in complex with TGFβ receptor I (TGFβRI) in fibroblasts and determined a close proximity between both proteins suggesting a potential physical interaction between the two at the plasma membrane. This was supported by in silico studies predicting Hsp90 dimers and TGFβRI extracellular domain interaction. Both, Hsp90aa1 and Hsp90ab1 isoforms participate in TGFβRI complex. Extracellular Hsp90 inhibition lessened the yield of collagen production as well as the canonical TGFβ signaling cascade, and collagen protein synthesis was drastically reduced in Hsp90aa1 KO mice. These observations together with the significant increase in activity of Hsp90 at the plasma membrane pointed to a functional cooperative partnership between Hsp90 and TGFβRI in the fibrotic process. We propose that a surface population of Hsp90 extracellularly binds TGFβRI and this complex behaves as an active participant in collagen production in TGFβ-activated fibroblasts. We also offer an in vivo insight into the role of Hsp90 and its isoforms during cardiac remodeling in murine aortic banding model suffering from pathological cardiac remodeling and detect circulating Hsp90 overexpressed in remodeling mice.\n",

      "Transcriptome RNA-sequencing data of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples were used to detect the mRNA expression of FBXL6. Immunoprecipitation/Mass Spectrum (IP/MS) method was used to identify the interacting proteins of FBXL6. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to determine the interaction between FBXL6 and HSP90AA1. The in vivo ubiquitination assay was performed to determine the regulation of HSP90AA1 by FBXL6. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to determine the transcriptional regulation of FBXL6 by c-MYC. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to study the correlation of FBXL6 and HSP90AA1 protein expression in 87 HCC samples. Cell counting and colony formation assays were implemented to detect the biological effects of FBXL6 on the growth of HCC cells in vitro. The effect of FBXL6 on HCC tumor growth in vivo was studied in a tumor xenograft model in mice.\n",
      "Here, we identified the orphan F-box protein FBXL6, a substrate recognition subunit of an SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complex, as the ubiquitin ligase for HSP90AA1. FBXL6 promoted K63-dependent ubiquitination of HSP90AA1 to stabilize it. Through analysis of the TCGA dataset, we found that FBXL6 was significantly increased in HCC tissues and positively correlated with c-MYC pathway. FBXL6 accumulation in HCC causes the stabilization and activation of c-MYC by preventing HSP90AA1 degradation. The activated c-MYC directly binds to the promoter region of FBXL6 to induce its mRNA expression.\n",

      "The NF-κB family of inducible transcription factors is activated in response to a variety of stimuli. Amongst the best-characterized inducers of NF-κB are members of the TNF family of cytokines. Research on NF-κB and TNF have been tightly intertwined for more than 25 years. Perhaps the most compelling examples of the interconnectedness of NF-κB and the TNF have come from analysis of knock-out mice that are unable to activate NF-κB. Such mice die embryonically, however, deletion of TNF or TNFR1 can rescue the lethality thereby illustrating the important role of NF-κB as the key regulator of transcriptional responses to TNF. The physiological connections between NF-κB and TNF cytokines are numerous and best explored in articles focusing on a single TNF family member. Instead, in this review, we explore general mechanisms of TNF cytokine signaling, with a focus on the upstream signaling events leading to activation of the so-called canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways by TNFR1 and CD40, respectively.\n",

      "The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory response; however, the precise mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is poorly understood. Here, we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human and mouse lung epithelial cells also produced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly were non-inflammatory, but elicited an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-κB pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation of the NF-κB pathway was abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of S protein-induced IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Notably, upon recognition of S protein, TLR2 dimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 to activate the NF-κB pathway. Taken together, these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "TNF is a master proinflammatory cytokine whose pathogenic role in inflammatory disorders has long been attributed to induction of proinflammatory mediators. TNF also activates cell survival and death pathways, and recent studies demonstrated that TNF also causes inflammation by inducing cell death. The default response of most cells to TNF is survival and NF-κB-mediated upregulation of prosurvival molecules is a well-documented protective mechanism downstream of TNFR1. Recent studies revealed the existence of an NF-κB-independent cell death checkpoint that restricts cell demise by inactivating RIPK1. Disruption of this checkpoint leads to RIPK1 kinase-dependent death and causes inflammation in vivo. These revelations bring complexity to the control of TNF-induced cell death, and suggest clinical benefit of RIPK1 inhibitors in TNF-driven human inflammatory disorders.\n",

      "Activation of the stress-responsive transcription factor NRF2 is the major line of defense to combat oxidative or electrophilic insults. Under basal conditions, NRF2 is continuously ubiquitylated by the KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is targeted to the proteasome for degradation (the canonical mechanism). However, the path from the CUL3 complex to ultimate proteasomal degradation was previously unknown. p97 is a ubiquitin-targeted ATP-dependent segregase that extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from membranes, protein complexes, or chromatin and has an essential role in autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). In this study, we show that p97 negatively regulates NRF2 through the canonical pathway by extracting ubiquitylated NRF2 from the KEAP1-CUL3 E3 complex, with the aid of the heterodimeric cofactor UFD1/NPL4 and the UBA-UBX-containing protein UBXN7, for efficient proteasomal degradation. Given the role of NRF2 in chemoresistance and the surging interest in p97 inhibitors to treat cancers, our results indicate that dual p97/NRF2 inhibitors may offer a more potent and long-term avenue of p97-targeted treatment.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The proteins from the UBA-UBX family interact with ubiquitylated proteins via their UBA domain and with p97 via their UBX domain, thereby acting as substrate-binding adaptors for the p97 ATPase. In particular, human UBXN7 (also known as UBXD7) mediates p97 interaction with the transcription factor HIF1α that is actively ubiquitylated in normoxic cells by a CUL2-based E3 ligase, CRL2. Mass spectrometry analysis of UBA-UBX protein immunoprecipitates showed that they interact with a multitude of E3 ubiquitin-ligases. Conspicuously, UBXN7 was most proficient in interacting with cullin-RING ligase subunits. We therefore set out to determine whether UBXN7 interaction with cullins was direct or mediated by its ubiquitylated targets bound to the UBA domain.\n",
      "We show that UBXN7 interaction with cullins is independent of ubiquitin- and substrate-binding. Instead, it relies on the UIM motif in UBXN7 that directly engages the NEDD8 modification on cullins. To understand the functional consequences of UBXN7 interaction with neddylated cullins, we focused on HIF1α, a CUL2 substrate that uses UBXD7/p97 as a ubiquitin-receptor on its way to proteasome-mediated degradation. We find that UBXN7 over-expression converts CUL2 to its neddylated form and causes the accumulation of non-ubiquitylated HIF1α. Both of these effects are strictly UIM-dependent and occur only when UBXN7 contains an intact UIM motif. We also show that HIF1α carrying long ubiquitin-chains can recruit alternative ubiquitin-receptors, lacking p97's ATP-dependent segregase activity.\n",
      "Our study shows that independently of its function as a ubiquitin-binding adaptor for p97, UBXN7 directly interacts with neddylated cullins and causes the accumulation of the CUL2 substrate HIF1α. We propose that by sequestering CUL2 in its neddylated form, UBXN7 negatively regulates the ubiquitin-ligase activity of CRL2 and this might prevent recruitment of ubiquitin-receptors other than p97 to nuclear HIF1α.\n",

      "A balance between protein synthesis and degradation is necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis. Failure to triage aberrant proteins may result in their accumulation and aggregation in the cytosol. The valosin-containing protein (VCP)-BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6) complex facilitates a wide variety of ubiquitin-mediated quality control events at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), both prior to ER translocation and during ER-associated degradation (ERAD). However, how ubiquitylated clients associated with BAG6 are recognized by VCP for proteasomal degradation is presently unknown. We have identified UBXN1 as the VCP adaptor in BAG6-dependent processes occurring prior to ER insertion but not during ERAD. The loss of VCP-UBXN1 results in the inappropriate stabilization of ubiquitylated BAG6 clients and their accumulation in insoluble aggregates and sensitizes cells to proteotoxic stress. Our results identify how VCP is specifically targeted to ubiquitylated substrates in the BAG6 triage pathway and suggest that the degradation of ubiquitylated clients by the proteasome is reliant on the association of UBXN1 with ubiquitylated substrates and the catalytic activity of VCP.\n",

      "Immune parameters change with time of day and disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to inflammatory pathologies. A circadian-clock-controlled immune system might allow an organism to anticipate daily changes in activity and feeding and the associated risk of infection or tissue damage to the host. Responses to bacteria have been shown to vary depending on time of infection, with mice being more at risk of sepsis when challenged ahead of their activity phase. Studies highlight the extent to which the molecular clock, most notably the core clock proteins BMAL1, CLOCK, and REV-ERBα, control fundamental aspects of the immune response. Examples include the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer regulating toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) expression and repressing expression of the inflammatory monocyte chemokine ligand (CCL2) as well as REV-ERBα suppressing the induction of interleukin-6. Understanding the daily rhythm of the immune system could have implications for vaccinations and how we manage infectious and inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "Disrupted sleep-wake and molecular circadian rhythms are a feature of aging associated with metabolic disease and reduced levels of NAD<sup>+</sup>, yet whether changes in nucleotide metabolism control circadian behavioral and genomic rhythms remains unknown. Here, we reveal that supplementation with the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) markedly reprograms metabolic and stress-response pathways that decline with aging through inhibition of the clock repressor PER2. NR enhances BMAL1 chromatin binding genome-wide through PER2<sup>K680</sup> deacetylation, which in turn primes PER2 phosphorylation within a domain that controls nuclear transport and stability and that is mutated in human advanced sleep phase syndrome. In old mice, dampened BMAL1 chromatin binding, transcriptional oscillations, mitochondrial respiration rhythms, and late evening activity are restored by NAD<sup>+</sup> repletion to youthful levels with NR. These results reveal effects of NAD<sup>+</sup> on metabolism and the circadian system with aging through the spatiotemporal control of the molecular clock.\n",

      "The biological clocks of the circadian timing system coordinate cellular and physiological processes and synchronizes these with daily cycles, feeding patterns also regulates circadian clocks. The clock genes and adipocytokines show circadian rhythmicity. Dysfunction of these genes are involved in the alteration of these adipokines during the development of obesity. Food availability promotes the stimuli associated with food intake which is a circadian oscillator outside of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Its circadian rhythm is arranged with the predictable daily mealtimes. Food anticipatory activity is mediated by a self-sustained circadian timing and its principal component is food entrained oscillator. However, the hypothalamus has a crucial role in the regulation of energy balance rather than food intake. Fatty acids or their metabolites can modulate neuronal activity by brain nutrient-sensing neurons involved in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. The timing of three-meal schedules indicates close association with the plasma levels of insulin and preceding food availability. Desynchronization between the central and peripheral clocks by altered timing of food intake and diet composition can lead to uncoupling of peripheral clocks from the central pacemaker and to the development of metabolic disorders. Metabolic dysfunction is associated with circadian disturbances at both central and peripheral levels and, eventual disruption of circadian clock functioning can lead to obesity. While CLOCK expression levels are increased with high fat diet-induced obesity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha increases the transcriptional level of brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) in obese subjects. Consequently, disruption of clock genes results in dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and obesity. Modifying the time of feeding alone can greatly affect body weight. Changes in the circadian clock are associated with temporal alterations in feeding behavior and increased weight gain. Thus, shift work is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases as a result of unusual eating time and disruption of circadian rhythm.\n",

      "DNA was extracted from fresh frozen normal tissue from 349 CRC patients underwent curative surgery and then genotyped for 5 polymorphisms (PPP1R13L rs1970764 and rs1005165; CD3EAP rs967591; ERCC1 rs735482 and rs11615) using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).\n",
      "Among the 5 polymorphisms, PPP1R13L rs1970764 was significantly associated with relapse-free (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in a recessive model. In haplotype analysis, three haplotypes (TACC, CGAC, and CGAT) were selected for analysis among 6 haplotypes constructed by the PHASE II program using 4 polymorphisms (rs1005165, rs967591, rs735482, and rs11615) in a moderate to strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D' > 0.4), and a significant difference in RFS was observed among patients with these 3 haplotypes. In the multivariate analysis, the GG genotype of PPP1R13L rs1970764 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for poor RFS and DSS (HR = 1.743 and 1.734; P = 0.003 and 0.010, respectively) when compared with the combine AA/AG genotype adjusted to clinicopathologic variables. In particular, the prognostic impact of PPP1R13L rs1970764 was persistent only in patients with rectal cancer (HR = 3.307 and 3.180; both P < 0.001 for RFS and DSS, respectively).\n",

      "Somatic missense mutations in the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) Aα scaffold subunit gene PPP2R1A are among the few genomic alterations that occur frequently in serous endometrial carcinoma (EC) and carcinosarcoma, two clinically aggressive subtypes of uterine cancer with few therapeutic options. Previous studies reported that cancer-associated Aα mutants exhibit defects in binding to other PP2A subunits and contribute to cancer development by a mechanism of haploinsufficiency. Here we report on the functional significance of the most recurrent PPP2R1A mutations in human EC, which cluster in Aα HEAT repeats 5 and 7. Beyond predicted loss-of-function effects on the formation of a subset of PP2A holoenzymes, we discovered that Aα mutants behave in a dominant-negative manner due to gain-of-function interactions with the PP2A inhibitor TIPRL1. Dominant-negative Aα mutants retain binding to specific subunits of the B56/B' family and form substrate trapping complexes with impaired phosphatase activity via increased recruitment of TIPRL1. Accordingly, overexpression of the Aα mutants in EC cells harboring wild-type PPP2R1A increased anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation, and triggered hyperphosphorylation of oncogenic PP2A-B56/B' substrates in the GSK3β, Akt, and mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathways. TIPRL1 silencing restored GSK3β phosphorylation and rescued the EC cell growth advantage. Our results reveal how PPP2R1A mutations affect PP2A function and oncogenic signaling, illuminating the genetic basis for serous EC development and its potential control by rationally targeted therapies.

      "The serine-threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric enzyme family that plays an essential regulatory role in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Mutations in the genes encoding PP2A-Aα/β subunits are associated with tumorigenesis and other human diseases. To explore whether genetic variations in the promoter region of the PP2A-Aα gene (PPP2R1A) and their frequent haplotypes in the Han Chinese population have an impact on transcriptional activity, we collected DNA samples from 63 healthy Chinese donors and searched for genetic variations in the 5'-flanking promoter region of PPP2R1A (PPP2R1Ap). Haplotypes were characterized by Haploview analysis and individual subcloning. A set of molecular and functional experiments was performed using reporter genes and electrophoretic mobility shifting assay (EMSA). Seven genetic variations were identified within the promoter locus (2038bp) of PPP2R1A. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and haplotype profiles were analyzed using the identified genetic variants. Using serially truncated human PPP2R1A promoter luciferase constructs, we found that a 685bp (-448nt to +237nt) fragment around the transcription start site (TSS) was the core promoter region. Individual subcloning revealed the existence of six haplotypes in this proximal promoter region of PPP2R1Ap. Using luciferase reporter assays, we found that different haplotypes bearing different variant alleles exhibit distinct promoter activities. The EMSA revealed that the -241 -/G variant influences DNA-protein interactions involving the transcription factor NF-κB, which may regulate the activity of the PPP2R1A proximal promoter. Our findings suggest that functional genetic variants in the proximal promoter of the PP2A-Aα gene and their haplotypes are critical in the regulation of transcriptional activation.\n",

      "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a critical effector of oncogenic RAS signaling, and MAPK pathway inhibition may be an effective combination treatment strategy. We performed genome-scale loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 screens in the presence of a MEK1/2 inhibitor (MEKi) in KRAS-mutant pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines and identified genes that cooperate with MEK inhibition. While we observed heterogeneity in genetic modifiers of MEKi sensitivity across cell lines, several recurrent classes of synthetic lethal vulnerabilities emerged at the pathway level. Multiple members of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS-MAPK pathways scored as sensitizers to MEKi. In particular, we demonstrate that knockout, suppression, or degradation of SHOC2, a positive regulator of MAPK signaling, specifically cooperated with MEK inhibition to impair proliferation in RAS-driven cancer cells. The depletion of SHOC2 disrupted survival pathways triggered by feedback RTK signaling in response to MEK inhibition. Thus, these findings nominate SHOC2 as a potential target for combination therapy.\n",

      "FBXW7 is a tumor suppressive E3 ligase, whereas RAS-ERK and mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTORC1) are two major oncogenic pathways. Whether and how FBXW7 regulates these two oncogenic pathways are unknown. Here, we showed that SHOC2, a RAS activator, is a FBXW7 substrate. Growth stimuli trigger SHOC2 phosphorylation on Thr<sup>507</sup> by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal, which facilitates FBXW7 binding for ubiquitylation and degradation. FBXW7-mediated SHOC2 degradation terminates the RAS-MAPK signals and inhibits proliferation. Furthermore, SHOC2 selectively binds to Raptor to competitively inhibit the Raptor-mTOR binding to inactivate mTORC1 and induce autophagy, whereas Raptor binding of SHOC2 inhibits the SHOC2-RAS binding to block the MAPK pathway and proliferation. Finally, SHOC2 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, which correlated with poor patient survival. SHOC2 mutations were found in lung cancer tissues with gain-of-function activity. Collectively, the SHOC2-Raptor interaction triggers negative cross-talk between RAS-ERK and mTORC1 pathways, whereas FBXW7 regulates both pathways by targeting SHOC2 for ubiquitylation and degradation.\n",

      "Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS signalling through the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade regulates cell proliferation and survival. The SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C holophosphatase complex functions as a key regulator of RTK-RAS signalling by removing an inhibitory phosphorylation event on the RAF family of proteins to potentiate MAPK signalling<sup>1</sup>. SHOC2 forms a ternary complex with MRAS and PP1C, and human germline gain-of-function mutations in this complex result in congenital RASopathy syndromes<sup>2-5</sup>. However, the structure and assembly of this complex are poorly understood. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to resolve the structure of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C complex. We define the biophysical principles of holoenzyme interactions, elucidate the assembly order of the complex, and systematically interrogate the functional consequence of nearly all of the possible missense variants of SHOC2 through deep mutational scanning. We show that SHOC2 binds PP1C and MRAS through the concave surface of the leucine-rich repeat region and further engages PP1C through the N-terminal disordered region that contains a cryptic RVXF motif. Complex formation is initially mediated by interactions between SHOC2 and PP1C and is stabilized by the binding of GTP-loaded MRAS. These observations explain how mutant versions of SHOC2 in RASopathies and cancer stabilize the interactions of complex members to enhance holophosphatase activity. Together, this integrative structure-function model comprehensively defines key binding interactions within the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C holophosphatase complex and will inform therapeutic development .\n",

      "Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes exist in three distinct, final-form assemblies: canonical BAF (cBAF), PBAF and a newly characterized non-canonical complex (ncBAF). However, their complex-specific targeting on chromatin, functions and roles in disease remain largely undefined. Here, we comprehensively mapped complex assemblies on chromatin and found that ncBAF complexes uniquely localize to CTCF sites and promoters. We identified ncBAF subunits as synthetic lethal targets specific to synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumours, which both exhibit cBAF complex (SMARCB1 subunit) perturbation. Chemical and biological depletion of the ncBAF subunit, BRD9, rapidly attenuates synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumour cell proliferation. Importantly, in cBAF-perturbed cancers, ncBAF complexes maintain gene expression at retained CTCF-promoter sites and function in a manner distinct from fusion oncoprotein-bound complexes. Together, these findings unmask the unique targeting and functional roles of ncBAF complexes and present new cancer-specific therapeutic targets.\n",

      "Mammalian SWI/SNF family chromatin remodelers, BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), regulate chromatin structure and transcription, and their mutations are linked to cancers. The 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of human BAF bound to the nucleosome reveals that the nucleosome is sandwiched by the base and the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) modules, which are bridged by the actin-related protein (ARP) module. The ATPase motor is positioned proximal to nucleosomal DNA and, upon ATP hydrolysis, engages with and pumps DNA along the nucleosome. The C-terminal α helix of SMARCB1, enriched in positively charged residues frequently mutated in cancers, mediates interactions with an acidic patch of the nucleosome. AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) and the SWI/SNF complex subunit SMARCC serve as a structural core and scaffold in the base module organization, respectively. Our study provides structural insights into subunit organization and nucleosome recognition of human BAF complex.\n",

      "The identification of mutations and deletions in the SMARCB1 locus in chromosome band 22q11.2 in pediatric rhabdoid tumors provided the first evidence for the involvement of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in cancer. Over the last 15 years, alterations in more than 20 members of the complex have been reported in a variety of human tumors. These include germline mutations and copy number alterations in SMARCB1, SMARCA4, SMARCE1, and PBRM1 that predispose carriers to both benign and malignant neoplasms. Somatic mutations, structural abnormalities, or epigenetic modifications that lead to reduced or aberrant expression of complex members have now been reported in more than 20% of malignancies, including both solid tumors and hematologic disorders in both children and adults. In this review, we will highlight the role of SMARCB1 in cancer as a paradigm for other tumors with alterations in SWI/SNF complex members and demonstrate the broad spectrum of mutations observed in complex members in different tumor types.\n",

      "Pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGG) are the most frequent brain tumors in children. Up to 50% will be refractory to conventional chemotherapy. It is now known that the majority of PLGG have activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. The same pathway is also activated in plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) which are low-grade tumors involving peripheral nerves in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These lesions are known to be refractory to chemotherapy. Specific MEK inhibitors such as trametinib are now available and have been approved for other cancers harboring mutations in the MAPK/ERK pathway such as melanoma. We have observed significant responses to trametinib in patients with refractory PLGG in our institutions and results from the phase I study are promising. The treatment appears not only efficacious but is also usually well tolerated. We hypothesize that we will observe responses in the majority of refractory PLGG and PN treated with trametinib in this phase 2 study.\n",
      "The primary objective is to determine the objective response rate of trametinib as a single agent for treatment of progressing/refractory tumors with MAPK/ERK pathway activation. The TRAM-01 study is a phase II multicentric open-label basket trial including four groups. Group 1 includes NF1 patients with progressing/refractory glioma. Group 2 includes NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibroma. Group 3 includes patients with progressing/refractory glioma with KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Group 4 includes other patients with progressing/refractory glioma with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Eligible patients for a given study group will receive daily oral trametinib at full dose for a total of 18 cycles of 28 days. A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in seven Canadian centers. Secondary objectives include the assessment of progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability of trametinib, serum levels of trametinib and evaluation of quality of life during treatment.\n",
      "Trametinib will allow us to target directly and specifically the MAPK/ERK pathway. We expect to observe a significant response in most patients. Following our study, trametinib could be integrated into standard treatment of PLGG and PN.\n",

      "Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are the major effector cells that lead to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovitis and joint destruction. Our previous studies showed that Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is involved in aberrant activation of RA-FLSs and inhibition of SHH pathway decreases proliferation and migration of RA-FLSs. The objective of this study was to investigate if the SHH pathway mediates proliferation and migration of RA-FLSs <i>via</i> the mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway. SHH signaling was studied by using SHH agonist (Purmorphamine) and antagonist (Cyclopamine) targeting the Smoothened (SMO) in FLSs. U0126-EtOH was used to inhibit the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 (p-ERKl/2) was examined by western blot. Cell viability was detected using cell proliferation and cytotoxicity kit-8 (CCK8), and cell cycle distribution and proliferating cells were evaluated by the flow cytometry. Cell migration was examined by Transwell assay. Results showed that, compared with the control group, Purmorphamine increased the levels of p-ERK1/2 in concentration-and time-dependent manners (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Co-treated with Purmorphamine and U0126-EtOH or Cyclopamine both decreased the levels of p-ERK1/2 (<i>P</i> < 0.05). RA-FLSs treated with Purmorphamine resulted in alteration of cell cycle distribution, increasing of proliferating cells, cell viability, and migration cells compared to controls (<i>P</i> < 0.01). However, the above phenomenon can be abolished by U0126-EtOH (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The findings suggest that SHH signaling pathway mediates proliferation and migration of RA-FLSs <i>via</i> MAPK/ERK pathway and may contribute to progression of RA. Targeting SHH signaling may have a therapeutic potential in patients with RA.\n",

      "The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) comprise a particular branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (MAPK) that transmits extracellular signals into the intracellular environment to trigger cellular growth responses. Similar to other MAPK cascades, the MAPK-ERK pathway signals through three core kinases-Raf, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and ERK-which drive the signaling mechanisms responsible for the induction of cellular responses from extracellular stimuli including differentiation, proliferation, and cellular survival. However, pathogens like DNA viruses alter MAPK-ERK signaling in order to access DNA replication machineries, induce a proliferative state in the cell, or even prevent cell death mechanisms in response to pathogen recognition. Differential utilization of this pathway by multiple DNA viruses highlights the dynamic nature of the MAPK-ERK pathway within the cell and the importance of its function in regulating a wide variety of cellular fates that ultimately influence viral infection and, in some cases, result in tumorigenesis.\n",

      "Less than 30% of the cases of Brugada syndrome (BrS) have an identified genetic cause. Of the known BrS-susceptibility genes, loss-of-function mutations in SCN5A or CACNA1C and their auxiliary subunits are most common. On the basis of the recent demonstration that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) homologous factors (FHFs; FGF11-FGF14) regulate cardiac Na(+) and Ca(2+) channel currents, we hypothesized that FHFs are candidate BrS loci.\n",
      "The goal of this study was to test whether FGF12 is a candidate BrS locus.\n",
      "We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to identify the major FHF expressed in the human ventricle and then queried a phenotype-positive, genotype-negative BrS biorepository for FHF mutations associated with BrS. We queried the effects of an identified mutant with biochemical analyses combined with electrophysiological assessment. We designed a novel rat ventricular cardiomyocyte system in which we swapped the endogenous FHF with the identified mutant and defined its effects on multiple ionic currents in their native milieu and on the cardiac action potential.\n",
      "We identified FGF12 as the major FHF expressed in the human ventricle. In 102 individuals in the biorepository, we identified a single missense mutation in FGF12-B (Q7R-FGF12). The mutant reduced binding to the NaV1.5 C terminus, but not to junctophilin-2. In adult rat cardiac myocytes, Q7R-FGF12, but not wild-type FGF12, reduced Na(+) channel current density and availability without affecting Ca(2+) channel function. Furthermore, the mutant, but not wild-type FGF12, reduced action potential amplitude, which is consistent with a mutant-induced loss of Na(+) channel function.\n",
      "These multilevel investigations strongly suggest that Q7R-FGF12 is a disease-associated BrS mutation. Moreover, these data suggest for the first time that FHF effects on Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels are separable. Most significantly, this study establishes a new method to analyze effects of human arrhythmogenic mutations on cardiac ionic currents.\n",

      "Fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11) is an intracellular FGF. Although induction of FGF11 by hypoxia has been observed in several cell types, the molecular function of FGF11 is not clearly understood yet. Here, we investigated the role of FGF11 under hypoxia. We identified hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) as an interacting protein of FGF11 using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. FGF11 knockdown decreased HIF-1α protein, while FGF11 overexpression increased it, without affecting HIF-1α mRNA. Protein stability test and ubiquitination assay showed that FGF11 increased HIF-1α stability by acting upstream of proteasomal degradation. Altogether, these results suggest a cross-regulation between HIF-1α and FGF11, through which hypoxia-induced FGF11 reinforces hypoxia responses by enhancing the stability of HIF-1α.\n",

      "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) modulate their phenotype between synthetic and contractile states in response to environmental changes; this modulation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of restenosis and atherosclerosis. Here, we identified fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12) as a novel key regulator of the VSMC phenotype switch.\n",
      "Using murine models and human specimens, we found that FGF12 was highly expressed in contractile VSMCs of normal vessel walls but was downregulated in synthetic VSMCs from injured and atherosclerotic vessels. In human VSMCs, FGF12 expression was inhibited at the transcriptional level by platelet-derived growth factor-BB. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that FGF12 was both necessary and sufficient for inducing and maintaining the quiescent and contractile phenotypes of VSMCs. FGF12 inhibited cell proliferation through the p53 pathway and upregulated the key factors involved in VSMC lineage differentiation, such as myocardin and serum response factor. Such FGF12-induced phenotypic change was mediated by the p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. Moreover, FGF12 promoted the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and the transdifferentiation of human dermal fibroblasts into SMC-like cells. Furthermore, adenoviral infection of FGF12 substantially decreased neointima hyperplasia in a rat carotid artery injury model.\n",
      "In general, FGF family members induce a synthetic VSMC phenotype. Interestingly, the present study showed the unanticipated finding that FGF12 belonging to FGF family, strongly induced the quiescent and contractile VSMC phenotypes and directly promoted VSMC lineage differentiation. These novel findings suggested that FGF12 could be a new therapeutic target for treating restenosis and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "Epigenetics is the study of heritable alterations in gene expression that are not accompanied by the corresponding change in DNA sequence. Three interlinked epigenetic processes regulate gene expression at the level of chromatin, namely DNA methylation, nucleosomal remodeling and histone covalent modifications. Post-translational modifications that occur on certain amino acid residues of the tails of histone proteins modify chromatin structure and form the basis for \"histone code\". The enzymes Histone Acetyl Transferase (HAT) and Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) control the level of acetylation of histones and thereby alter gene expression. In many cancers, the balance between HAT and HDAC is altered. HDAC enzymes are grouped into four different classes namely Class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8), Class II (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, and HDAC10), Class III HDAC and Class IV (HDAC11). Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACI) exert anticancer activity by promoting acetylation of histones as well as by promoting acetylation of non-histone protein substrates. The effects of HDACI on gene transcription are complex. They cause cell cycle arrest, inhibit DNA repair, induce apoptosis and acetylate non histone proteins causing downstream alterations in gene expression. HDACI are a diverse group of compounds, which vary in structure, biological activity, and specificity. In general, HDACIs contain a zinc-binding domain, a capping group, and a straight chain linker connecting the two. They are classified into four classes namely short chain fatty acids, hydroxamic acids, cyclic peptides and synthetic benzamides. This review describes the clinical utility of HDACI as monotherapy as well as combination therapy with other treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Adverse effects and shortcomings of treatment with HDACI are also discussed in detail.\n",

      "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) catalyzes the removal of the acetyl group from the lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of nucleosomal core histones. Eight human HDACs have been identified so far. Here, we report the identification of a ninth member of the HDAC family, designated HDAC9. HDAC9 is a class II HDAC and its gene resides on human chromosome 7. HDAC9 has several alternatively spliced isoforms. One of these isoforms is histone deacetylase-related protein or myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2-interacting transcriptional repressor that we and others have previously reported and which does not possess an HDAC catalytic domain. The longest of the HDAC9 isoforms contains 1,011 aa. The isoform, designated HDAC9a, is 132 aa shorter at the C terminus than HDAC9. Also, we have identified isoforms of HDAC9 that lack the nuclear localization signal. Similar to histone deacetylase-related protein, HDAC9 transcripts are expressed at high levels in brain and skeletal muscle. The ratio of HDAC9 and HDAC9a transcripts differs among the tissues examined. HDAC9 and HDAC9a contain the HDAC catalytic domain, and Flag-tagged HDAC9 and HDAC9a possess deacetylase activity. HDAC9 and HDAC9a also repress myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2-mediated transcription. In the present study, we have identified HDAC9 and a number of alternatively spliced isoforms of HDAC9 with potentially different biological activities.\n",

      "Lysine ɛ-acetylation is a post-translational modification that alters the biochemical properties of many proteins. The reaction is catalyzed by histone/protein acetyltransferases (HATs), and is reversed by histone/protein deacetylases (HDACs). As a result, HATs and HDACs constitute an important, though little recognized, set of proteins that control the functions of T-regulatory (Treg) cells. Targeting certain HDACs, especially HDAC6, HDAC9, and Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1), can augment Treg suppressive potency by several distinct and potentially additive mechanisms. These involve promoting Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) gene expression and preserving Foxp3 lysine ɛ-acetylation, which infers resistance to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and increases DNA binding. Moreover, depleting certain HDAC can enhance the heat shock response, which increases the tenacity of Treg to survive under stress, and helps preserve a suppressive phenotype. As a result, HDAC inhibitor therapy can be used to enhance Treg functions in vivo and have beneficial effects on allograft survival and autoimmune diseases.\n",

We evaluate genetic variation in the c-Jun-N-terminal kinases, p38, and extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 MAPK-signaling pathways and colon and rectal cancer risk using data from population-based case-control studies (colon: n = 1555 cases, 1956 controls; rectal: n = 754 cases, 959 controls). We assess 19 genes (DUSP1, DUSP2, DUSP4, DUSP6, DUSP7, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, MAP3K2, MAP3K3, MAP3K7, MAP3K9, MAP3K10, MAP3K11, MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, MAPK12, MAPK14 and RAF1). MAP2K1 rs8039880 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38, 0.83; GG versus AA genotype] and MAP3K9 rs11625206 (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.14, 1.76; recessive model) were associated with colon cancer (P (adj) value < 0.05). DUSP1 rs322351 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.88; TT versus CC) and MAPK8 rs10857561 (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.08, 2.03; AA versus GG/GA) were associated with rectal cancer (P (adj) < 0.05). Aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, cigarette smoking and body mass index interacted with several genes to alter cancer risk. Genetic variants had unique associations with KRAS, TP53 and CIMP+ tumors. DUSP2 rs1724120 [hazard rate ratio (HRR) = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.54, 0.96; AA versus GG/GA), MAP3K10 rs112956 (HRR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.76; CT/TT versus CC) and MAP3K11 (HRR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.18, 2.62 TT versus GG/GT) influenced survival after diagnosis with colon cancer; MAP2K1 rs8039880 (HRR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.34, 4.79 GG versus AG/GG) and Raf1 rs11923427 (HRR = 0.59 95% CI = 0.40, 0.86; AA versus TT/TA) were associated with rectal cancer survival. These data suggest that genetic variation in the MAPK-signaling pathway influences colorectal cancer risk and survival after diagnosis. Associations may be modified by lifestyle factors that influence inflammation and oxidative stress.\n",

Associations between genes in the DUSP, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK-signaling pathways and dietary factors associated with growth factors, inflammation, and oxidative stress and risk of colon and rectal cancer were evaluated. Data include colon cases (n = 1555) and controls (n = 1956) and rectal cases (n = 754) and controls (n = 959). Statistically significant interactions were observed for the MAPK-signaling pathways after adjustment for multiple comparisons. DUSP genes interacted with carbohydrates, mutagen index, calories, calcium, vitamin D, lycopene, dietary fats, folic acid, and selenium. MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK1, and RAF1 within the ERK1/2 MAPK-signaling pathway interacted with dietary fats and cruciferous vegetables. Within the JNK MAPK-signaling pathway, interactions between MAP3K7 and protein, vitamin C, iron, folic acid, carbohydrates, and cruciferous vegetables; MAP3K10 and folic acid; MAP3K9 and lutein/zeaxanthin; MAPK8 and calcium; MAP3K3 and calcium and lutein; MAP3K1 and cruciferous vegetables. Interaction within the p38-signaling pathway included MAPK14 with calories, carbohydrates saturated fat, selenium, vitamin C; MAP3K2 and carbohydrates, and folic acid.

      "As prostate cancer progresses to castration-resistant disease, there is an increase in signal transduction activity. Most castration-resistant prostate tumors continue to express the androgen receptor (AR) as well as androgen-responsive genes, despite the near absence of circulating androgen in these patients. The AR is regulated not only by its cognate steroid hormone, but also by interactions with a constellation of co-regulatory and signaling molecules. Thus, the elevated signaling activity that occurs during progression to castration resistance can affect prostate cancer cell growth either through the AR or independent of the AR. In order to identify signaling pathways that regulate prostate cancer cell growth, we screened a panel of shRNAs targeting 673 human kinases against LNCaP prostate cancer cells grown in the presence and absence of hormone. The screen identified multiple shRNA clones against known and novel gene targets that regulate prostate cancer cell growth. Based on the magnitude of effect on growth, we selected six kinases for further study: MAP3K11, DGKD, ICK, CIT, GALK2, and PSKH1. Knockdown of these kinases decreased cell growth in both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. However, these kinases had different effects on basal or androgen-induced transcriptional activity of AR target genes. MAP3K11 knockdown most consistently altered transcription of AR target genes, suggesting that MAP3K11 affected its growth inhibitory effect by modulating the AR transcriptional program. Consistent with MAP3K11 acting on the AR, knockdown of MAP3K11 inhibited AR Ser 650 phosphorylation, further supporting stress kinase regulation of AR phosphorylation. This study demonstrates the applicability of lentiviral-based shRNA for conducting phenotypic screens and identifies MAP3K11, DGKD, ICK, CIT, GALK2, and PSKH1 as regulators of prostate cancer cell growth. The thorough evaluation of these kinase targets will pave the way for developing more effective treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n",

      "IB1/JIP-1 is a scaffold protein that regulates the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, which is activated by environmental stresses and/or by treatment with proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. The JNKs play an essential role in many biological processes, including the maturation and differentiation of immune cells and the apoptosis of cell targets of the immune system. IB1 is expressed predominantly in brain and pancreatic beta-cells where it protects cells from proapoptotic programs. Recently, a mutation in the amino-terminus of IB1 was associated with diabetes. A novel isoform, IB2, was cloned and characterized. Overall, both IB1 and IB2 proteins share a very similar organization, with a JNK-binding domain, a Src homology 3 domain, a phosphotyrosine-interacting domain, and polyacidic and polyproline stretches located at similar positions. The IB2 gene (HGMW-approved symbol MAPK8IP2) maps to human chromosome 22q13 and contains 10 coding exons. Northern and RT-PCR analyses indicate that IB2 is expressed in brain and in pancreatic cells, including insulin-secreting cells. IB2 interacts with both JNK and the JNK-kinase MKK7. In addition, ectopic expression of the JNK-binding domain of IB2 decreases IL-1beta-induced pancreatic beta-cell death. These data establish IB2 as a novel scaffold protein that regulates the JNK signaling pathway in brain and pancreatic beta-cells and indicate that IB2 represents a novel candidate gene for diabetes.\n",

      "Zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) are the largest transcription factor family in mammals, involved in the regulation of multiple physiologic processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and neoplastic transformation. Approximately one-third of ZFPs are Krüppel-associated box domain (KRAB)-ZFPs. <b>Methods</b>: ZNF471 expression and methylation were detected by reverse-transcription PCR and methylation-specific PCR. The impact and mechanism of ectopic ZNF471 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. <b>Results</b>: We identified a 19q13 KRAB-ZFP, <i>ZNF471</i>, as a methylated target in ESCC. We further found that ZNF471 is significantly downregulated in ESCC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues, due to its aberrant promoter CpG methylation, and further confirmed by methylation analysis and treatment with demethylation agent. Restoration of ZNF471 expression in silenced ESCC cells significantly altered cell morphology, induced apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest, and inhibited tumor cell colony formation, viability, migration and invasion. Importantly, ZNF471 was found to activate the expression of <i>MAPK10/JNK3</i> and <i>PCDH</i> family genes, and further enhance MAPK10 signaling and downstream gene expression through binding to the <i>MAPK10/JNK3</i> promoter. <b>Conclusion</b>: Our results demonstrate that ZNF471 is an important tumor suppressor and loss of ZNF471 functions hampers <i>MAPK10/JNK3</i> signaling during esophageal carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Obesity, which has long since reached epidemic proportions worldwide, is associated with long-term stress to a variety of organs and results in diseases including type 2 diabetes. In the brain, overnutrition induces hypothalamic stress associated with the activation of several signalling pathways, together with central insulin and leptin resistance. This central action of nutrient overload appears very rapidly, suggesting that nutrition-induced hypothalamic stress is a major upstream initiator of obesity and associated diseases. The cellular response to nutrient overload includes the activation of the stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3, which are widely expressed in the brain. Here, we review recent findings on the regulation and effects of these kinases, with particular focus on the hypothalamus, a key brain region in the control of energy and glucose homeostasis. JNK1 blocks the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, reducing energy expenditure and promoting obesity. Recently, opposing roles have been identified for JNK1 and JNK3 in hypothalamic agouti gene-related protein (AgRP) neurons: while JNK1 activation in AgRP neurons induces feeding and weight gain and impairs insulin and leptin signalling, JNK3 (also known as MAPK10) deletion in the same neuronal population produces very similar effects. The opposing roles of these kinases, and the unknown role of hypothalamic JNK2, reflect the complexity of JNK biology. Future studies should address the specific function of each kinase, not only in different neuronal subsets, but also in non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system. Decoding the puzzle of brain stress kinases will help to define the central stimuli and mechanisms implicated in the control of energy balance. Graphical abstract.\n",

      "More than a hundred proteins comprise the RAS superfamily of small GTPases. This family can be divided into RAS, RHO, RAB, RAN, ARF, and RAD subfamilies, with each shown to play distinct roles in human cells in both health and disease. The RAS subfamily has a well-established role in human cancer with the three genes, <i>HRAS</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, and <i>NRAS</i> being the commonly mutated in tumors. These <i>RAS</i> mutations, most often functionally activating, are especially common in pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers. Efforts to inhibit RAS and related GTPases have produced inhibitors targeting the downstream effectors of RAS signaling, including inhibitors of the RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-ERK kinase pathway and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-AKT-mTOR kinase pathway. A third effector arm of RAS signaling, mediated by RAL (RAS like) has emerged in recent years as a critical driver of RAS oncogenic signaling and has not been targeted until recently. RAL belongs to the RAS branch of the RAS superfamily and shares a high structural similarity with RAS. In human cells, there are two genes, <i>RALA</i> and <i>RALB</i>, both of which have been shown to play roles in the proliferation, survival, and metastasis of a variety of human cancers, including lung, colon, pancreatic, prostate, skin, and bladder cancers. In this review, we summarize the latest knowledge of RAL in the context of human cancer and the recent advancements in the development of cancer therapeutics targeting RAL small GTPases.\n",

      "The Ral guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), RalA and RalB, are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. Research on Ral GTPases and their functions over the past 25 years has revealed the essential involvement of these GTPases in unique and diverse cellular processes including exocyst-mediated exocytosis and related cellular activities. Moreover, it is increasingly appreciated that the aberrant activation of Ral GTPases is one of the major causes of human tumourigenesis induced by oncogenic Ras. Recent evidence suggests that Ral signalling pathways may be potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of human cancers. This review summarizes recent advance in the investigation of Ral GTPases.\n",

      "RalA and RalB are monomeric G proteins that are 83% identical in amino acid sequence but have paralogue-specific effects on cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis. Using in vitro kinase assays and phosphosite-specific antibodies, here we show phosphorylation of RalB by protein kinase C (PKC) and RalA by protein kinase A. We used mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis to identify S198 as the primary PKC phosphorylation site in RalB. Phorbol ester [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)] treatment of human bladder carcinoma cells induced S198 phosphorylation of stably expressed FLAG-RalB as well as endogenous RalB. PMA treatment caused RalB translocation from the plasma membrane to perinuclear regions in a S198 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Using RNA interference depletion of RalB followed by rescue with wild-type RalB or RalB(S198A) as well as overexpression of wild-type RalB or RalB(S198A) with and without PMA stimulation, we show that phosphorylation of RalB at S198 is necessary for actin cytoskeletal organization, anchorage-independent growth, cell migration, and experimental lung metastasis of T24 or UMUC3 human bladder cancer cells. In addition, UMUC3 cells transfected with a constitutively active RalB(G23V) exhibited enhanced subcutaneous tumor growth, whereas those transfected with phospho-deficient RalB(G23V-S198A) were indistinguishable from control cells. Our data show that RalA and RalB are phosphorylated by different kinases, and RalB phosphorylation is necessary for in vitro cellular functions and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis.\n",

      "Beta-arrestins are multifunctional adaptors that mediate the desensitization, internalization, and some signaling functions of seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs). Agonist-stimulated ubiquitination of beta-arrestin2 mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 is critical for rapid beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) internalization. We now report the discovery that the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) binds beta-arrestin2 and leads to the deubiquitination of beta-arrestins. USP33 and Mdm2 function reciprocally and favor respectively the stability or lability of the receptor beta-arrestin complex, thus regulating the longevity and subcellular localization of receptor signalosomes. Receptors such as the beta(2)AR, previously shown to form loose complexes with beta-arrestin (\"class A\") promote a beta-arrestin conformation conducive for binding to the deubiquitinase, whereas the vasopressin V2R, which forms tight beta-arrestin complexes (\"class B\"), promotes a distinct beta-arrestin conformation that favors dissociation of the enzyme. Thus, USP33-beta-arrestin interaction is a key regulatory step in 7TMR trafficking and signal transmission from the activated receptors to downstream effectors.\n",

      "Slit regulates migration of not only neurons, but also nonneuronal cells, such as leukocytes and cancer cells. Slit effect on cancer cell migration has not been well-characterized. In this study, we used several different assays to examine Slit effect on breast cancer cell migration in vitro. We show that ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33)/VDU1, originally identified as a von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) protein-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme, binds to the Robo1 receptor, and that USP33 is required for Slit responsiveness in breast cancer cells. Slit induces redistribution of Robo1 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane in a USP33-dependent manner. Slit impairs directional migration of breast cancer cells without affecting their migration speed. This inhibitory effect is Robo-mediated and USP33-dependent. These data uncover a previously unknown function of USP33 and reveal a new player in Slit-Robo signaling in cancer cell migration.\n",

      "Originally discovered in neuronal guidance, the Slit-Robo pathway is emerging as an important player in human cancers. However, its involvement and mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that Slit2 expression is reduced in CRC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. Extensive promoter hypermethylation of the Slit2 gene has been observed in CRC cells, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the Slit2 downregulation in CRC. Functional studies showed that Slit2 inhibits CRC cell migration in a Robo-dependent manner. Robo-interacting ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) is required for the inhibitory function of Slit2 on CRC cell migration by deubiquitinating and stabilizing Robo1. USP33 expression is downregulated in CRC samples, and reduced USP33 mRNA levels are correlated with increased tumor grade, lymph node metastasis and poor patient survival. Taken together, our data reveal USP33 as a previously unknown tumor-suppressing gene for CRC by mediating the inhibitory function of Slit-Robo signaling on CRC cell migration. Our work suggests the potential value of USP33 as an independent prognostic marker of CRC.\n",

      "The early hematopoietic zinc finger protein/zinc finger protein 521 (EHZF/ZNF521) is a recently identified, 1131 amino-acid-long nuclear factor that contains 30 zinc fingers distributed in clusters throughout its sequence. A 13-AA motif, that binds to components of the nuclear remodelling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex and is conserved in several trascriptional co-repressors, is located at the amino-terminal end of the molecule. EHZF/ZNF521 expression is high in the most immature cells of the haematopoietic system and declines with differentiation. Its transcript is also abundant in brain, particularly in the cerebellum. Its murine counterpart, Evi3/Zfp521, is enriched in haematopoietic and neural stem cells, in cerebellar granule neuron precursors and in the developing striatum. Enforced expression of EHZF/ZNF521 in haematopoietic progenitors results in their expansion and in inhibition of differentiation. EHZF/ZNF521 is a member of the BMP signalling pathway and an inhibitor of the transcription factor OLF1/EBF1, implicated in the differentiation of neural progenitors and in the specification of the B-cell lineage. EHZF expression is observed in most acute myelogenous leukaemias and is particularly high in those with rearrangements of the MLL gene, where EHZF may contribute to the leukaemic phenotype. EHZF/ZNF521 is also abundant in medulloblastomas and other brain tumours. Taken together, the data available suggest a possible role for this factor in development, stem cell regulation and oncogenesis.\n",

Here, we show that this protein plays an important role in the control of B-cell development by inhibiting the activity of early B-cell factor-1 (EBF1), a master factor in B-lineage specification. In particular, our data demonstrate that: (1) ZNF521 binds to EBF1 via its carboxyl-terminal portion and this interaction is required for EBF1 inhibition; (2) NuRD complex recruitment by ZNF521 is not essential for the inhibition of transactivation of EBF1-dependent promoters; (3) ZNF521 represses EBF1 target genes in a human B-lymphoid molecular context; and (4) RNAi-mediated silencing of ZNF521/Zfp521 in primary human and murine hematopoietic progenitors strongly enhances the generation of B-lymphocytes in vitro. Taken together, our data indicate that ZNF521 can antagonize B-cell development and lend support to the notion that it may contribute to conserve the multipotency of primitive lympho-myeloid progenitors by preventing or delaying their EBF1-driven commitment toward the B-cell lineage.\n",

      "E2A-hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) is a chimeric protein found in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(17;19). To analyze the leukemogenic process and to create model mice for t(17;19)-positive leukemia, we generated inducible knock-in (iKI) mice for E2A-HLF. Despite the induced expression of E2A-HLF in the hematopoietic tissues, no disease was developed during the long observation period, indicating that additional gene alterations are required to develop leukemia. To elucidate this process, E2A-HLF iKI and control littermates were subjected to retroviral insertional mutagenesis. Virus infection induced acute leukemias in E2A-HLF iKI mice with higher morbidity and mortality than in control mice. Inverse PCR detected three common integration sites specific for E2A-HLF iKI leukemic mice, which induced overexpression of zinc-finger transcription factors: growth factor independent 1 (Gfi1), zinc-finger protein subfamily 1A1 isoform a (Zfp1a1, also known as Ikaros) and zinc-finger protein 521 (Zfp521). Interestingly, tumors with Zfp521 integration exclusively showed B-lineage ALL, which corresponds to the phenotype of human t(17;19)-positive leukemia. In addition, ZNF521 (human counterpart of Zfp521) was found to be overexpressed in human leukemic cell lines harboring t(17;19). Moreover, both iKI for E2A-HLF and transgenic for Zfp521 mice frequently developed B-lineage ALL. These results indicate that a set of transcription factors promote leukemic transformation of E2A-HLF-expressing hematopoietic progenitors and suggest that aberrant expression of Zfp521/ZNF521 may be clinically relevant to t(17;19)-positive B-lineage ALL.\n",

      "WNT/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway controls tissue polarity and cell movement through the activation of RHOA, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nemo-like kinase (NLK) signaling cascades. PCP is induced in Drosophila by the asymmetrical localization of Frizzled-Dishevelled-Diego-Starry night (Flamingo) complex and Van Gogh (Strabismus)-Prickle complex. Here, WNT/PCP signaling pathway implicated in human carcinogenesis is reviewed. Human WNT5A, WNT5B, and WNT11 are representative non-canonical WNTs transducing PCP signals through FZD3 or FZD6 receptors, and ROR1, ROR2 or PTK7 co-receptors. Human VANGL1, VANGL2 (Van Gogh homologs), CELSR1, CELSR2, CELSR3 (Starry night homologs), DVL1, DVL2, DVL3 (Dishevelled homologs), PRICKLE1, PRICKLE2 (Prickle homologs), and ANKRD6 (Diego homolog) are core PCP signaling molecules. MAGI3 assembles FZD, VANGL, PTEN, and adhesion molecules. Dishevelled-dependent WNT/PCP signals are transduced to the RHOA signaling cascade through Formin homology proteins DAAM1 and DAAM2, and to the JNK signaling cascade through MAPKKKs and MAPKK4/7. Dishevelled-independent WNT/ PCP signals are transduced to the NLK signaling cascade through MAP3K7 (TAK1). ANKRD6, NKD1 and NKD2 induce class switch from the WNT/GSK3beta signaling pathway to the WNT/PCP signaling pathway. WNT5A is up-regulated in various types of human cancer, such as gastric cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. FZD3/FZD6 receptor and ROR2 co-receptor transduce WNT5A signal in gastric cancer. Aberrant activation of WNT/PCP signaling pathway in human cancer leads to more malignant phenotypes, such as abnormal tissue polarity, invasion, and metastasis. cDNA-PCR, microarray or ELISA reflecting aberrant activation of WNT/PCP signaling pathway could be developed as novel cancer prognostics. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number polymorphism (CNP) of WNT/PCP signaling molecules mentioned above are suitable for use in screening of cancer predisposition, especially for gastric cancer. Antibody, RNAi, or small molecule compounds to regulate the function of WNT/PCP signaling molecules mentioned above are good candidates for development as novel cancer therapeutics.\n",

      "Targeting common oncogenic drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients has remained largely ineffective, raising the possibility that alternative pathways may contribute to tumor aggressiveness. Here we demonstrate that Vangl1 and Fzd7, components of the non-canonical Wnt planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling pathway, promote GBM malignancy by driving cellular proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, and engage Rho GTPases to promote cytoskeletal rearrangements and actin dynamics in migrating GBM cells. Mechanistically, we uncover the existence of a novel Vangl1/Fzd7 complex at the leading edge of migrating GBM cells and propose that this complex is critical for the recruitment of downstream effectors to promote tumor progression. Moreover, we observe that depletion of FZD7 results in a striking suppression of tumor growth and latency and extends overall survival in an intracranial mouse xenograft model. Our observations support a novel mechanism by which Wnt/PCP components Vangl1 and Fzd7 form a complex at the leading edge of migratory GBM cells to engage downstream effectors that promote actin cytoskeletal rearrangements dynamics. Our findings suggest that interference with Wnt/PCP pathway function may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for patients diagnosed with GBM.\n",

      "Pericytes are perivascular cells localized to capillaries that promote vessel maturation, and their absence can contribute to vessel loss. Whether impaired endothelial-pericyte interaction contributes to small vessel loss in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is unclear. Using 3G5-specific, immunoglobulin G-coated magnetic beads, we isolated pericytes from the lungs of healthy subjects and PAH patients, followed by lineage validation. PAH pericytes seeded with healthy pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells failed to associate with endothelial tubes, resulting in smaller vascular networks compared to those with healthy pericytes. After the demonstration of abnormal polarization toward endothelium via live-imaging and wound-healing studies, we screened PAH pericytes for abnormalities in the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which has been shown to regulate cell motility and polarity in the pulmonary vasculature. PAH pericytes had reduced expression of frizzled 7 (Fzd7) and cdc42, genes crucial for Wnt/PCP activation. With simultaneous knockdown of Fzd7 and cdc42 in healthy pericytes in vitro and in a murine model of angiogenesis, motility and polarization toward pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were reduced, whereas with restoration of both genes in PAH pericytes, endothelial-pericyte association was improved, with larger vascular networks. These studies suggest that the motility and polarity of pericytes during pulmonary angiogenesis are regulated by Wnt/PCP activation, which can be targeted to prevent vessel loss in PAH.\n",

      "WNT/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway controls tissue polarity and cell movement through the activation of RHOA, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nemo-like kinase (NLK) signaling cascades. PCP is induced in Drosophila by the asymmetrical localization of Frizzled-Dishevelled-Diego-Starry night (Flamingo) complex and Van Gogh (Strabismus)-Prickle complex. Here, WNT/PCP signaling pathway implicated in human carcinogenesis is reviewed. Human WNT5A, WNT5B, and WNT11 are representative non-canonical WNTs transducing PCP signals through FZD3 or FZD6 receptors, and ROR1, ROR2 or PTK7 co-receptors. Human VANGL1, VANGL2 (Van Gogh homologs), CELSR1, CELSR2, CELSR3 (Starry night homologs), DVL1, DVL2, DVL3 (Dishevelled homologs), PRICKLE1, PRICKLE2 (Prickle homologs), and ANKRD6 (Diego homolog) are core PCP signaling molecules. MAGI3 assembles FZD, VANGL, PTEN, and adhesion molecules. Dishevelled-dependent WNT/PCP signals are transduced to the RHOA signaling cascade through Formin homology proteins DAAM1 and DAAM2, and to the JNK signaling cascade through MAPKKKs and MAPKK4/7. Dishevelled-independent WNT/ PCP signals are transduced to the NLK signaling cascade through MAP3K7 (TAK1). ANKRD6, NKD1 and NKD2 induce class switch from the WNT/GSK3beta signaling pathway to the WNT/PCP signaling pathway. WNT5A is up-regulated in various types of human cancer, such as gastric cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. FZD3/FZD6 receptor and ROR2 co-receptor transduce WNT5A signal in gastric cancer. Aberrant activation of WNT/PCP signaling pathway in human cancer leads to more malignant phenotypes, such as abnormal tissue polarity, invasion, and metastasis. cDNA-PCR, microarray or ELISA reflecting aberrant activation of WNT/PCP signaling pathway could be developed as novel cancer prognostics. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number polymorphism (CNP) of WNT/PCP signaling molecules mentioned above are suitable for use in screening of cancer predisposition, especially for gastric cancer. Antibody, RNAi, or small molecule compounds to regulate the function of WNT/PCP signaling molecules mentioned above are good candidates for development as novel cancer therapeutics.\n",

      "Forward genetic screens with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing enable high-resolution detection of genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in RNF43-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, which rely on Wnt signaling for proliferation. Through these screens, we discovered a unique requirement for a Wnt signaling circuit: engaging FZD5, one of the ten Frizzled receptors encoded in the human genome. Our results uncover an underappreciated level of context-dependent specificity at the Wnt receptor level. We further derived a panel of recombinant antibodies that reports the expression of nine FZD proteins and confirms that FZD5 functional specificity cannot be explained by protein expression patterns. Additionally, antibodies that specifically bind FZD5 and FZD8 robustly inhibited the growth of RNF43-mutant PDAC cells grown in vitro and as xenografts in vivo, providing orthogonal support for the functional specificity observed genetically. Proliferation of a patient-derived PDAC cell line harboring an RNF43 variant was also selectively inhibited by the FZD5 antibodies, further demonstrating their use as a potential targeted therapy. Tumor organoid cultures from colorectal carcinoma patients that carried RNF43 mutations were also sensitive to the FZD5 antibodies, highlighting the potential generalizability of these findings beyond PDAC. Our results show that CRIPSR-based genetic screens can be leveraged to identify and validate cell surface targets for antibody development and therapy.\n",

      "Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have the potential for self-renewal, differentiation and de-differentiation, undergo epigenetic, epithelial-mesenchymal, immunological and metabolic reprogramming to adapt to the tumor microenvironment and survive host defense or therapeutic insults. Intra-tumor heterogeneity and cancer-cell plasticity give rise to therapeutic resistance and recurrence through clonal replacement and reactivation of dormant CSCs, respectively. WNT signaling cascades cross-talk with the FGF, Notch, Hedgehog and TGFβ/BMP signaling cascades and regulate expression of functional CSC markers, such as CD44, CD133 (PROM1), EPCAM and LGR5 (GPR49). Aberrant canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling in human malignancies, including breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovary, pancreatic, prostate and uterine cancers, leukemia and melanoma, are involved in CSC survival, bulk-tumor expansion and invasion/metastasis. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics, such as anti-FZD1/2/5/7/8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (vantictumab), anti-LGR5 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) (mAb-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE), anti-PTK7 ADC (PF-06647020), anti-ROR1 mAb (cirmtuzumab), anti-RSPO3 mAb (rosmantuzumab), small-molecule porcupine inhibitors (ETC-159, WNT-C59 and WNT974), tankyrase inhibitors (AZ1366, G007-LK, NVP-TNKS656 and XAV939) and β-catenin inhibitors (BC2059, CWP232228, ICG-001 and PRI-724), are in clinical trials or preclinical studies for the treatment of patients with WNT-driven cancers. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics are applicable for combination therapy with BCR-ABL, EGFR, FLT3, KIT or RET inhibitors to treat a subset of tyrosine kinase-driven cancers because WNT and tyrosine kinase signaling cascades converge to β-catenin for the maintenance and expansion of CSCs. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics might also be applicable for combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockers, such as atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, to treat cancers with immune evasion, although the context-dependent effects of WNT signaling on immunity should be carefully assessed. Omics monitoring, such as genome sequencing and transcriptome tests, immunohistochemical analyses on PD-L1 (CD274), PD-1 (PDCD1), ROR1 and nuclear β-catenin and organoid-based drug screening, is necessary to determine the appropriate WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics for cancer patients.\n",

      "WNT/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway controls tissue polarity and cell movement through the activation of RHOA, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nemo-like kinase (NLK) signaling cascades. PCP is induced in Drosophila by the asymmetrical localization of Frizzled-Dishevelled-Diego-Starry night (Flamingo) complex and Van Gogh (Strabismus)-Prickle complex. Here, WNT/PCP signaling pathway implicated in human carcinogenesis is reviewed. Human WNT5A, WNT5B, and WNT11 are representative non-canonical WNTs transducing PCP signals through FZD3 or FZD6 receptors, and ROR1, ROR2 or PTK7 co-receptors. Human VANGL1, VANGL2 (Van Gogh homologs), CELSR1, CELSR2, CELSR3 (Starry night homologs), DVL1, DVL2, DVL3 (Dishevelled homologs), PRICKLE1, PRICKLE2 (Prickle homologs), and ANKRD6 (Diego homolog) are core PCP signaling molecules. MAGI3 assembles FZD, VANGL, PTEN, and adhesion molecules. Dishevelled-dependent WNT/PCP signals are transduced to the RHOA signaling cascade through Formin homology proteins DAAM1 and DAAM2, and to the JNK signaling cascade through MAPKKKs and MAPKK4/7. Dishevelled-independent WNT/ PCP signals are transduced to the NLK signaling cascade through MAP3K7 (TAK1). ANKRD6, NKD1 and NKD2 induce class switch from the WNT/GSK3beta signaling pathway to the WNT/PCP signaling pathway. WNT5A is up-regulated in various types of human cancer, such as gastric cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. FZD3/FZD6 receptor and ROR2 co-receptor transduce WNT5A signal in gastric cancer. Aberrant activation of WNT/PCP signaling pathway in human cancer leads to more malignant phenotypes, such as abnormal tissue polarity, invasion, and metastasis. cDNA-PCR, microarray or ELISA reflecting aberrant activation of WNT/PCP signaling pathway could be developed as novel cancer prognostics. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number polymorphism (CNP) of WNT/PCP signaling molecules mentioned above are suitable for use in screening of cancer predisposition, especially for gastric cancer. Antibody, RNAi, or small molecule compounds to regulate the function of WNT/PCP signaling molecules mentioned above are good candidates for development as novel cancer therapeutics.\n",

      "Components of the evolutionarily conserved developmental planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway were recently described to play a prominent role in cancer cell dissemination. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PCP molecules drive the spread of cancer cells remain largely unknown. PRICKLE1 encodes a PCP protein bound to the promigratory serine/threonine kinase MINK1. We identify RICTOR, a member of the mTORC2 complex, as a PRICKLE1-binding partner and show that the integrity of the PRICKLE1-MINK1-RICTOR complex is required for activation of AKT, regulation of focal adhesions, and cancer cell migration. Disruption of the PRICKLE1-RICTOR interaction results in a strong impairment of breast cancer cell dissemination in xenograft assays. Finally, we show that upregulation of PRICKLE1 in basal breast cancers, a subtype characterized by high metastatic potential, is associated with poor metastasis-free survival.\n",

      "The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway controls the process of convergent extension (CE) during gastrulation and neural tube closure, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects (NTDs) in animal models and human cohorts. In this study, we analyzed the role of one core PCP gene PRICKLE1 in these malformations. We screened this gene in 810 unrelated NTD patients and identified seven rare missense heterozygous mutations that were absent in all controls analyzed and predicted to be functionally deleterious using bioinformatics. Functional validation of five PRICKLE1 variants in a zebrafish model demonstrated that one variant, p.Arg682Cys, antagonized the CE phenotype induced by the wild-type zebrafish prickle1a (zpk1a) in a dominant fashion. Our study demonstrates that PRICKLE1 could act as a predisposing factor to human NTDs and further expands our knowledge of the role of PCP genes in the pathogenesis of these malformations.\n",

      "<b>Background:</b> Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are highly tumorigenic, chemotherapy-resistant, tumor growth-sustaining, and are implicated in tumor recurrence. Previous studies have shown that lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A) is highly expressed in several human malignancies and CSCs. However, the role of KDM1A in CSCs and the therapeutic potential of KDM1A inhibitors for the treatment of the advanced thyroid cancer are poorly understood. <b>Methods:</b> Firstly, KDM1A was identified as an important epigenetic modifier that maintained the stemness of thyroid cancer through a mini histone methylation modifier screen and confirmed in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines. RNA sequence was performed to discover the downstream genes of KDM1A. The underlying mechanisms were further investigated by ChIP, IP and dual luciferase reporter assays, gain and loss of function assays. <b>Results:</b> Here we report that KDM1A regulates the stemness of thyroid cancer and promotes thyroid cancer progression via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Mechanistically, KDM1A down-regulates two antagonists of the canonical Wnt pathway, APC2 and DKK1, by demethylating H3K4me1/2 of the APC2 promoter region and the nonhistone substrate HIF-1α, resulting in the inhibition of APC2 transcription and the activation of the HIF-1α/microRNA-146a/DKK1 axis. Importantly, we also demonstrate that GSK-LSD1, a highly selective inhibitor of KDM1A, significantly inhibits thyroid cancer progression and enhances the sensitivity of thyroid cancer to chemotherapy. <b>Conclusions:</b> KDM1A plays an important role in thyroid cancer progression and maintains stemness, our study provides a new strategy for the therapy of advanced thyroid cancer.\n",

      "The Hippo transducers YAP/TAZ have been shown to play positive, as well as negative, roles in Wnt signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we provide biochemical, functional, and genetic evidence that YAP and TAZ are integral components of the β-catenin destruction complex that serves as cytoplasmic sink for YAP/TAZ. In Wnt-ON cells, YAP/TAZ are physically dislodged from the destruction complex, allowing their nuclear accumulation and activation of Wnt/YAP/TAZ-dependent biological effects. YAP/TAZ are required for intestinal crypt overgrowth induced by APC deficiency and for crypt regeneration ex vivo. In Wnt-OFF cells, YAP/TAZ are essential for β-TrCP recruitment to the complex and β-catenin inactivation. In Wnt-ON cells, release of YAP/TAZ from the complex is instrumental for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In line, the β-catenin-dependent maintenance of ES cells in an undifferentiated state is sustained by loss of YAP/TAZ. This work reveals an unprecedented signaling framework relevant for organ size control, regeneration, and tumor suppression.\n",

      "FAT1, FAT2, FAT3 and FAT4 are human homologs of Drosophila Fat, which is involved in tumor suppression and planar cell polarity (PCP). FAT1 and FAT4 undergo the first proteolytic cleavage by Furin and are predicted to undergo the second cleavage by γ‑secretase to release intracellular domain (ICD). Ena/VAPS‑binding to FAT1 induces actin polymerization at lamellipodia and filopodia to promote cell migration, while Scribble‑binding to FAT1 induces phosphorylation and functional inhibition of YAP1 to suppress cell growth. FAT1 is repressed in oral cancer owing to homozygous deletion or epigenetic silencing and is preferentially downregulated in invasive breast cancer. On the other hand, FAT1 is upregulated in leukemia and prognosis of preB‑ALL patients with FAT1 upregulation is poor. FAT4 directly interacts with MPDZ/MUPP1 to recruit membrane‑associated guanylate kinase MPP5/PALS1. FAT4 is involved in the maintenance of PCP and inhibition of cell proliferation. FAT4 mRNA is repressed in breast cancer and lung cancer due to promoter hypermethylation. FAT4 gene is recurrently mutated in several types of human cancers, such as melanoma, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. FAT1 and FAT4 suppress tumor growth via activation of Hippo signaling, whereas FAT1 promotes tumor migration via induction of actin polymerization. FAT1 is tumor suppressive or oncogenic in a context‑dependent manner, while FAT4 is tumor suppressive. Copy number aberration, translocation and point mutation of FAT1, FAT2, FAT3, FAT4, FRMD1, FRMD6, NF2, WWC1, WWC2, SAV1, STK3, STK4, MOB1A, MOB1B, LATS1, LATS2, YAP1 and WWTR1/TAZ genes should be comprehensively investigated in various types of human cancers to elucidate the mutation landscape of the FAT‑Hippo signaling cascades. Because YAP1 and WWTR1 are located at the crossroads of adhesion, GPCR, RTK and stem‑cell signaling network, cancer genomics of the FAT signaling cascades could be applied for diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics in the era of personalized medicine.\n",

      "The expression of FAT4 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR in relation to the clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer patients. The effects of FAT4 silencing on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium) assay, and migration and invasion assays in gastric cancer cell lines in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model in vivo.\n",
      "Downregulation of FAT4 expression in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues was correlated with lymph-node metastasis and poor survival. Knockdown of FAT4 promoted the growth and invasion of gastric cancer cells via the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer cells, as demonstrated by the upregulation and downregulation of mesenchymal and epithelial markers. Silencing of FAT4 promoted tumour growth and metastasis in a gastric cancer xenograft model in vivo.\n",

FAT1, FAT2, FAT3 and FAT4 are Cadherin superfamily members homologous to Drosophila Fat, functioning as a positive regulator of PCP in the Drosophila wing. Complete coding sequence (CDS) for human FAT1 (NM_005245.3) and FAT2 (NM_001447.1) are available, while artificial CDS for human FAT3 (XM_926199 and XM_936538) and partial CDS for FAT4 (NM_024582.2). Here, complete CDS of human FAT3 and FAT4 were determined by using bioinformatics and human intelligence (Humint). FAT3 gene, consisting of 26 exons, encoded a 4557-aa protein with extracellular 33 Cadherin repeats, one Laminin G (LamG) domain and two EGF domains. FAT4 gene encoded a 4924-aa protein with extracellular 34 Cadherin repeats, two LamG domains and three EGF domains. Cytoplasmic VCSVxPxLP and SDYxS motifs were identified as novel motifs conserved among FAT1, FAT2 and FAT3 orthologs. Domain architecture comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that FAT1, FAT2 and FAR3 were divergent from FAT4. FAT1-MTNR1A locus at 4q35.2 and FAT3-MTNR1B locus at 11q14.3-q21 were paralogous regions within the human genome. FAT1 mRNA was expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, neural tissues, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and brain tumors. FAT2 mRNA was expressed in infant brain, cerebellum, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, skin squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer. FAT3 mRNA was expressed in ES cells, primitive neuroectoderm, fetal brain, infant brain, adult neural tissues and prostate. FAT4 mRNA was expressed in fetal brain, infant brain, brain tumor and colorectal cancer.

      "The biological antagonism between the signaling proteins Numb and Notch has been implicated in the regulation of many developmental processes, especially in asymmetric cell division. Mechanistic studies show that Numb inactivates Notch via endocytosis and proteasomal degradation that directly reduce Notch protein levels at the cell surface. However, some aspects of how Numb antagonizes Notch remain unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism in which Numb acts as a Notch antagonist by controlling the intracellular destination and stability of the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll4) through a postendocytic-sorting process. We observed that Numb/Numblike knockdown increases the stability and cell-surface accumulation of Dll4. Further study indicated that Numb acts as a sorting switch to control the postendocytic trafficking of Dll4. Of note, the Numb/Numblike knockdown decreased Dll4 delivery to the lysosome, while increasing the recycling of Dll4 to the plasma membrane. Moreover, we demonstrate that this enrichment of Dll4 at the cell surface within Numb/Numblike knockdown cells could activate Notch signaling in neighboring cells. We also provide evidence that Numb negatively controls the Dll4 plasma membrane recycling through a well-documented recycling regulator protein AP1. In conclusion, our study has uncovered a molecular mechanism whereby Numb regulates the endocytic trafficking of the Notch ligand Dll4. Our findings provide a new perspective on how Numb counteracts Notch signaling and sheds additional critical insights into the antagonistic relationship between Numb and Notch signaling.\n",

      "A variety of human birth defects originate in failure of closure of the embryonic neural tube. The genetic cause of the most common nonsyndromic defects, spina bifida (SB) or anencephaly, is considered to be combinations of variants at multiple genes. The genes contributing to the etiology of neural tube closure defects (NTDs) are unknown. Mutations in planar cell polarity (PCP) genes in mice cause a variety of defects including the NTD, craniorachischisis, and sometimes SB or exencephaly (EX); they also demonstrate the role of digenic combinations of PCP mutants in NTDs. Recent studies have sought rare predicted-to-be-deleterious alterations (putative mutations) in coding sequence of PCP genes in human cases with various anomalies of the neural tube. This review summarizes the cumulative results of these studies according to a framework based on the embryopathogenesis of NTDs, and considers some of the insights from the approaches used and the limitations. Rare putative mutations in the PCP genes VANGL2, SCRIB, DACT1, and CELSR1 cumulatively contributed to over 20% of cases with craniorachischisis, a rare defect; no contributing variants were found for PRICKLE1 or PTK7. PCP rare putative mutations had a weaker role in myelomeningocele (SB), being found in approximately 6% of cases and cumulated across CELSR1, FUZ, FZD6, PRICKLE1, VANGL1, and VANGL2. These results demonstrate that PCP gene alterations contribute to the etiology of human NTDs. We recommend that future research should explore other types of PCP gene variant such as regulatory mutations and low frequency (1 to 5%) deleterious polymorphisms.\n",

      "Defects in the biosynthesis and/or function of primary cilia cause a spectrum of disorders collectively referred to as ciliopathies. A subset of these disorders is distinguished by profound abnormalities of the skeleton that include a long narrow chest with markedly short ribs, extremely short limbs, and polydactyly. These include the perinatal lethal short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) and the less severe asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD), Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) syndrome, and cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) phenotypes. To identify new genes and define the spectrum of mutations in the skeletal ciliopathies, we analyzed 152 unrelated families with SRPS, ATD, and EVC. Causal variants were discovered in 14 genes in 120 families, including one newly associated gene and two genes previously associated with other ciliopathies. These three genes encode components of three different ciliary complexes; FUZ, which encodes a planar cell polarity complex molecule; TRAF3IP1, which encodes an anterograde ciliary transport protein; and LBR, which encodes a nuclear membrane protein with sterol reductase activity. The results established the molecular basis of SRPS type IV, in which mutations were identified in four different ciliary genes. The data provide systematic insight regarding the genotypes associated with a large cohort of these genetically heterogeneous phenotypes and identified new ciliary components required for normal skeletal development.\n",

      "Cilia play key roles in development and homeostasis, and defects in cilia structure or function lead to an array of human diseases. Ciliogenesis is accomplished by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, a set of proteins governing bidirectional transport of cargoes within ciliary axonemes. In this paper, we present a novel platform for in vivo analysis of vertebrate IFT dynamics. Using this platform, we show that the planar cell polarity (PCP) effector Fuz was required for normal IFT dynamics in vertebrate cilia, the first evidence directly linking PCP to the core machinery of ciliogenesis. Further, we show that Fuz played a specific role in trafficking of retrograde, but not anterograde, IFT proteins. These data place Fuz in the small group of known IFT effectors outside the core machinery and, additionally, identify Fuz as a novel cytoplasmic effector that differentiates between the retrograde and anterograde IFT complexes.\n",

      "Pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in the tumor microenvironment lead to eradication of anti-tumor immunity and enhanced tumor cell survival. In the current study, we identified tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) as a major factor triggering cancer cell immunosuppression against T cell surveillance via stabilization of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). We demonstrated that COP9 signalosome 5 (CSN5), induced by NF-κB p65, is required for TNF-α-mediated PD-L1 stabilization in cancer cells. CSN5 inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of PD-L1. Inhibition of CSN5 by curcumin diminished cancer cell PD-L1 expression and sensitized cancer cells to anti-CTLA4 therapy.\n",

Besides, NF-κB altered signaling has been causally linked to ageing and diverse pathological conditions. We discuss herein the functional involvement of this signaling pathway in ageing, visiting recent experimental evidence about NF-κB activation in this complex process, its functional consequences and the novel biological functions raised from these works. Moreover, we discuss ageing intervention strategies based on NF-κB inhibition, which have demonstrated to be effective at delaying and even reverting different ageing manifestations in human and mouse models of both normal and accelerated ageing. Altogether, the current evidence supports that NF-κB activation constitutes a driving force of the ageing process and a preferential target for rejuvenation-aimed approaches.\n",

      "The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a signaling platform controlling the cellular ubiquitylation status. It determines the activity and remodeling of ~700 cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which control more than 20% of all ubiquitylation events in cells and thereby influence virtually any cellular pathway. In addition, it is associated with deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) protecting CRLs from autoubiquitylation and rescuing ubiquitylated proteins from degradation. The coordination of ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation by the CSN is presumably important for fine-tuning the precise formation of defined ubiquitin chains. Considering its intrinsic DUB activity specific for deneddylation of CRLs and belonging to the JAMM family as well as its associated DUBs, the CSN represents a multi-DUB complex. Two CSN-associated DUBs, the ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) and USP48 are regulators in the NF-κB signaling pathway. USP15 protects CRL1<sup>β-TrCP</sup> responsible for IκBα ubiquitylation, whereas USP48 stabilizes the nuclear pool of the NF-κB transcription factor RelA upon TNF stimulation by counteracting CRL2<sup>SOCS1</sup>. Moreover, the CSN controls the neddylation status of cells by its intrinsic DUB activity and by destabilizing the associated deneddylation enzyme 1 (DEN1). Thus, the CSN is a master regulator at the intersection between ubiquitylation and neddylation.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes that control cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as genes that respond to inflammation and immune responses. There are two means of NF-κB activation: the classical pathway, which involves the degradation of the inhibitor of κBα (IκBα), and the alternative pathway, which involves the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK, also known as MAP3K14). The mouse growth plate consists of the resting zone, proliferative zone, prehypertrophic zone, and hypertrophic zone. The p65 (RelA), which plays a central role in the classical pathway, is expressed throughout the cartilage layer, from the resting zone to the hypertrophic zone. Inhibiting the classical NF-κB signaling pathway blocks growth hormone (GH) or insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling, suppresses cell proliferation, and suppresses bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) expression, thereby promoting apoptosis. Since the production of autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-17, are regulated by the classical pathways and are increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), NF-κB inhibitors are used to suppress inflammation and joint destruction in RA models. In osteoarthritis (OA) models, the strength of NF-κB-activation is found to regulate the facilitation or suppression of OA. On the other hand, RelB is involved in the alternative pathway, and is expressed in the periarticular zone during the embryonic period of development. The alternative pathway is involved in the generation of chondrocytes in the proliferative zone during physiological conditions, and in the development of RA and OA during pathological conditions. Thus, NF-κB is an important molecule that controls normal development and the pathological destruction of cartilage.\n",

This pathway depends on the inducible processing of p100, a molecule functioning as both the precursor of p52 and a RelB-specific inhibitor. A central signaling component of the non-canonical pathway is NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which integrates signals from a subset of TNF receptor family members and activates a downstream kinase, IκB kinase-α (IKKα), for triggering p100 phosphorylation and processing. A unique mechanism of NIK regulation is through its fate control: the basal level of NIK is kept low by a TRAF-cIAP destruction complex and signal-induced non-canonical NF-κB signaling involves NIK stabilization. Tight control of the fate of NIK is important, since deregulated NIK accumulation is associated with lymphoid malignancies.\n",

      "The noncanonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway mediates activation of the p52/RelB NF-κB complex and, thereby, regulates specific immunological processes. This NF-κB pathway relies on the inducible processing of NF-κB2 precursor protein, p100, as opposed to the degradation of IκBα in the canonical NF-κB pathway. A central signaling component of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway is NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which functions together with a downstream kinase, IKKα (inhibitor of NF-κB kinase α), to induce phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and processing of p100. Under normal conditions, NIK is targeted for continuous degradation by a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase. In response to signals mediated by a subset of TNF receptor superfamily members, NIK becomes stabilized as a result of TRAF3 degradation, leading to the activation of noncanonical NF-κB. This review discusses both the historical perspectives and the recent progress in the regulation and biological function of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway.\n",

      "Hypoxia regulates autophagy and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptor, pyrin domain containing (NLRP)3, two innate immune mechanisms linked by mutual regulation and associated to IBD. Here we show that hypoxia ameliorates inflammation during the development of colitis by modulating autophagy and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/NLRP3 pathway. Hypoxia significantly reduces tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-6 and NLRP3 expression, and increases the turnover of the autophagy protein p62 in colon biopsies of Crohn's disease patients, and in samples from dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and Il-10 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. In vitro, NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 expression are reduced through hypoxia-induced autophagy. We also identify NLRP3 as a novel binding partner of mTOR. Dimethyloxalylglycine-mediated hydroxylase inhibition ameliorates colitis in mice, downregulates NLRP3 and promotes autophagy. We suggest that hypoxia counteracts inflammation through the downregulation of the binding of mTOR and NLRP3 and activation of autophagy.Hypoxia and HIF-1α activation are protective in mouse models of colitis, and the latter regulates autophagy. Here Cosin-Roger et al. show that hypoxia ameliorates intestinal inflammation in Crohn's patients and murine colitis models by inhibiting mTOR/NLRP3 pathway and promoting autophagy.\n",

      "Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by infection. The core mechanism underlying sepsis is immune dysfunction, with macrophages, as important cells of the innate immune system, playing an essential role. Autophagy has been shown to be closely related to inflammation and immunity, and autophagy enhancement in sepsis can play a protective role by negatively regulating abnormal macrophage activation, modulating macrophage polarization phenotype, reducing activation of the inflammasome and release of inflammatory factors, and affecting macrophage apoptosis. However, excessive autophagy may also lead to autophagic death of macrophages, which further aggravates the inflammatory response. The mechanisms underlying these functions are relatively complex and remain unclear, but may be related to a variety of signaling pathways such as NF-κB, mTOR, and PI3K/AKT. The administration of drugs to assist in the regulation of macrophage autophagy has become a novel treatment for sepsis. The present review focuses on the role and the potential mechanisms of macrophage autophagy in sepsis.\n",

      "Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of the heart leads to increased autophagic flux. Preconditioning stimulates autophagic flux by AMPK and PI3-kinase activation and mTOR inhibition. The cardioprotective effect of postconditioning is associated with activation of autophagy and increased activity of NO-synthase and AMPK. Oxidative stress stimulates autophagy in the heart during I/R. Superoxide radicals generated by NADPH-oxidase acts as a trigger for autophagy, possibly due to AMPK activation. There is reason to believe that AMPK, GSK-3β, PINK1, JNK, hexokinase II, MEK, PKCα, and ERK kinases stimulate autophagy, while mTOR, PKCδ, Akt, and PI3-kinase can inhibit autophagy in the heart during I/R. However, there is evidence that PI3-kinase could stimulate autophagy in ischemic preconditioning of the heart. It was found that transcription factors FoxO1, FoxO3, NF-κB, HIF-1α, TFEB, and Nrf-2 enhance autophagy in the heart in I/R. Transcriptional factors STAT1, STAT3, and p53 inhibit autophagy in I/R. MicroRNAs could stimulate and inhibit autophagy in the heart in I/R. Long noncoding RNAs regulate the viability and autophagy of cardiomyocytes in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Nitric oxide (NO) donors and endogenous NO could activate autophagy of cardiomyocytes. Activation of heme oxygenase-1 promotes cardiomyocyte tolerance to H/R and enhances autophagy. Hydrogen sulfide increases cardiac tolerance to I/R and inhibits apoptosis and autophagy via mTOR and PI3-kinase activation.\n",

      "The CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining immune tolerance in healthy individuals and are reported to restrict anti-inflammatory responses and thereby promote tumor progression, suggesting them as a target in the development of antitumor immunotherapy. Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is a key transcription factor governing Treg lineage differentiation and their immune-suppressive function. Here, using Treg cells, as well as HEK-293T and Jurkat T cells, we report that the stability of FOXP3 is directly and positively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 31 (RNF31), which catalyzes the conjugation of atypical ubiquitin chains to the FOXP3 protein. We observed that shRNA-mediated RNF31 knockdown in human Treg cells decreases FOXP3 protein levels and increases levels of interferon-γ, resulting in a Th1 helper cell-like phenotype. Human Treg cells that ectopically expressed RNF31 displayed stronger immune-suppressive capacity, suggesting that RNF31 positively regulates both FOXP3 stability and Treg cell function. Moreover, we found that RNF31 is up-regulated in Treg cells that infiltrate human gastric tumor tissues compared with their counterparts residing in peripheral and normal tissue. We also found that elevated RNF31 expression in intratumoral Treg cells is associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients, suggesting that RNF31 supports the immune-suppressive functions of Treg cells. Our results suggest that RNF31 could be a potential therapeutic target in immunity-based interventions against human gastric cancer.\n",

Although LUBAC also regulates the apoptosis pathway, the precise mechanism by which LUBAC regulates apoptosis remains not fully defined. Here, we report that LUBAC-mediated M1-linked ubiquitination of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP), an anti-apoptotic molecule, contributes to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-induced apoptosis. We found that deficiency of RNF31, the catalytic subunit of the LUBAC complex, promoted cFLIP degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed RNF31 directly interact with cFLIP, and LUBAC further conjugated M1-linked ubiquitination chains at Lys-351 and Lys-353 of cFLIP to stabilize cFLIP, thereby protecting cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis. Together, our study identifies a new substrate of LUBAC and reveals a new molecular mechanism through which LUBAC regulates TNFα-induced apoptosis via M1-linked ubiquitination.\n",

      "Macroautophagy/autophagy is a membrane-mediated intracellular degradation pathway, through which bulky cytoplasmic content is digested in lysosomes. How the autophagy initiation and maturation steps are regulated is not clear. In this study, we found an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) and a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) OTULIN localize to the phagophore area to control autophagy initiation and maturation. LUBAC key component RNF31/HOIP translocates to the LC3 puncta area when autophagy is induced. <i>RNF31</i> knockdown inhibits autophagy initiation, and cells are more sensitive to bacterial infection. <i>OTULIN</i> knockdown, however, promotes autophagy initiation but blocks autophagy maturation. In <i>OTULIN</i> knockdown cells, excessive ubiquitinated ATG13 protein was recruited to the phagophore for prolonged expansion, and therefore inhibits autophagosome maturation. Together, our study provides evidence that LUBAC and OTULIN cooperatively regulate autophagy initiation and autophagosome maturation by mediating the linear ubiquitination and the stabilization of ATG13.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG: autophagy-related; CALCOCO2/NDP52: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CQ: chloroquine; CUL1-FBXL20: cullin 1-F-box and leucine rich repeat protein 20; CUL3-KLHL20: cullin 3-kelch like family member 20; CUL4-AMBRA1: cullin 4-autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1; CYLD: CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DUB: deubiquitinating enzyme; EBSS: Earle's Balanced Salt Solution; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GST: glutathione S-transferase; IKBKG/NEMO: inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase regulatory subunit gamma; LUBAC: linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B; MIM: MIT-interacting motif; mRFP: monomeric red fluorescent protein; NEDD4: NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; NFKB: NF-kappaB complex; OPTN: optineurin; OTULIN: OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity; PIK3C3/Vps34: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; PtdIns: phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns3K: class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; RBCK1/HOIL1: RANBP2-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger containing 1; RB1CC1/FIP200: RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1; RIPK1: receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1; RNF216: ring finger protein 216; RNF31/HOIP: ring finger protein 31; RT-PCR: reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; S.

      "The p62 protein, also called sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), is a ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein that colocalizes with ubiquitinated protein aggregates in many neurodegenerative diseases and proteinopathies of the liver. The protein is able to polymerize via an N-terminal PB1 domain and can interact with ubiquitinated proteins via the C-terminal UBA domain. Also, p62/SQSTM1 binds directly to LC3 and GABARAP family proteins via a specific sequence motif. The protein is itself degraded by autophagy and may serve to link ubiquitinated proteins to the autophagic machinery to enable their degradation in the lysosome. Since p62 accumulates when autophagy is inhibited, and decreased levels can be observed when autophagy is induced, p62 may be used as a marker to study autophagic flux. Here, we present several protocols for monitoring autophagy-mediated degradation of p62 using Western blots, pulse-chase measurement of p62 half-life, immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy, as well as live cell imaging with a pH-sensitive mCherry-GFP double tag. We also present data on species-specificity and map the epitopes recognized by several commercially available anti-p62 antibodies.\n",

      "In selective autophagy, cytoplasmic components are selected and tagged before being sequestered into an autophagosome by means of selective autophagy receptors such as p62/SQSTM1. In this review, we discuss how selective autophagy is regulated. An important level of regulation is the selection of proteins or organelles for degradation. Components selected for degradation are tagged, often with ubiquitin, to facilitate recognition by autophagy receptors. Another level of regulation is represented by the autophagy receptors themselves. For p62, its ability to co-aggregate with ubiquitinated substrates is strongly induced by post-translational modifications (PTMs). The transcription of p62 is also markedly increased during conditions in which selective autophagy substrates accumulate. For other autophagy receptors, the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif is regulated by PTMs, inhibiting or stimulating the interaction with ATG8 family proteins. ATG8 proteins are also regulated by PTMs. Regulation of the capacity of the core autophagy machinery also affects selective autophagy. Importantly, autophagy receptors can induce local recruitment and activation of ULK1/2 and PI3KC3 complexes at the site of cargo sequestration.\n",

      "Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a key catabolic pathway for the maintenance of proteostasis through constant digestion of selective cargoes. The selectivity of autophagy is mediated by autophagy receptors that recognize and recruit cargoes to autophagosomes. SQSTM1/p62 is a prototype autophagy receptor, which is commonly found in protein aggregates associated with major neurodegenerative diseases. While accumulation of SQSTM1 implicates a disturbance of selective autophagy pathway, the pathogenic mechanism that contributes to impaired autophagy degradation remains poorly characterized. Herein we show that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-linked mutations of <i>TBK1</i> and <i>SQSTM1</i> disrupt selective autophagy and cause neurotoxicity. Our data demonstrates that proteotoxic stress activates serine/threonine kinase TBK1, which coordinates with autophagy kinase ULK1 to promote concerted phosphorylation of autophagy receptor SQSTM1 at the UBA domain and activation of selective autophagy. In contrast, ALS-FTLD-linked mutations of <i>TBK1</i> or <i>SQSTM1</i> reduce SQSTM1 phosphorylation and compromise ubiquitinated cargo binding and clearance. Moreover, disease mutation SQSTM1<sup>G427R</sup> abolishes phosphorylation of Ser351 and impairs KEAP1-SQSTM1 interaction, thus diminishing NFE2L2/Nrf2-targeted gene expression and increasing TARDBP/TDP-43 associated stress granule formation under oxidative stress. Furthermore, expression of SQSTM1<sup>G427R</sup> in neurons impairs dendrite morphology and KEAP1-NFE2L2 signaling. Therefore, our results reveal a mechanism whereby pathogenic SQSTM1 mutants inhibit selective autophagy and disrupt NFE2L2 anti-oxidative stress response underlying the neurotoxicity in ALS-FTLD.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; FTLD: frontotemporal lobar degeneration; G3BP1: GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1; GSTM1: glutathione S-transferase, mu 1; HMOX/HO-1: Heme oxygenase 1; IP: immunoprecipitation; KEAP1: kelch-like ECH associated protein 1; KI: kinase inactive; KIR: KEAP1 interaction region; KO: knockout; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MBP: maltose binding protein; NBR1: NBR1, autophagy cargo receptor; NFE2L2/Nrf2: nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; NQO1: NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; SOD1: superoxide dismutase 1, soluble; S.S.: serum starvation; TARDBP/TDP-43: TAR DNA binding protein; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; UBA: <i>ub</i>iquitin <i>a</i>ssociation; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WT: wild type.\n",

Viral infection, or the binding of double-stranded RNA to Toll-like receptor 3, results in the coordinate activation of IRF3 and NF-kappaB. Activation of IRF3 requires signal-dependent phosphorylation, but little is known about the signaling pathway or kinases involved. Here we report that the noncanonical IkappaB kinase homologs, IkappaB kinase-epsilon (IKKepsilon) and TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1), which were previously implicated in NF-kappaB activation, are also essential components of the IRF3 signaling pathway. Thus, IKKepsilon and TBK1 have a pivotal role in coordinating the activation of IRF3 and NF-kappaB in the innate immune response.\n",

      "Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) detects infections or tissue damage by binding to microbial or self DNA in the cytoplasm<sup>1</sup>. Upon binding DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP that binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING, which then activates the kinases IKK and TBK1 to induce interferons and other cytokines<sup>2-6</sup>. Here we report that STING also activates autophagy through a mechanism that is independent of TBK1 activation and interferon induction. Upon binding cGAMP, STING translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi in a process that is dependent on the COP-II complex and ARF GTPases. STING-containing ERGIC serves as a membrane source for LC3 lipidation, which is a key step in autophagosome biogenesis. cGAMP induced LC3 lipidation through a pathway that is dependent on WIPI2 and ATG5 but independent of the ULK and VPS34-beclin kinase complexes. Furthermore, we show that cGAMP-induced autophagy is important for the clearance of DNA and viruses in the cytosol. Interestingly, STING from the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis induces autophagy but not interferons in response to stimulation by cGAMP, which suggests that induction of autophagy is a primordial function of the cGAS-STING pathway.\n",

      "Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis.\n",

      "The NF-κB family of inducible transcription factors is activated in response to a variety of stimuli. Amongst the best-characterized inducers of NF-κB are members of the TNF family of cytokines. Research on NF-κB and TNF have been tightly intertwined for more than 25 years. Perhaps the most compelling examples of the interconnectedness of NF-κB and the TNF have come from analysis of knock-out mice that are unable to activate NF-κB. Such mice die embryonically, however, deletion of TNF or TNFR1 can rescue the lethality thereby illustrating the important role of NF-κB as the key regulator of transcriptional responses to TNF. The physiological connections between NF-κB and TNF cytokines are numerous and best explored in articles focusing on a single TNF family member. Instead, in this review, we explore general mechanisms of TNF cytokine signaling, with a focus on the upstream signaling events leading to activation of the so-called canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways by TNFR1 and CD40, respectively.\n",

      "NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) family transcription factors are master regulators of immune and inflammatory processes in response to both injury and infection. In the latent state, NF-κBs are sequestered in the cytosol by their inhibitor IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB) proteins. Upon stimulations of innate immune receptors such as Toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors such as those in the TNF (tumor necrosis factor) receptor superfamily, a series of membrane proximal events lead to the activation of the IKK (IκB kinase). Phosphorylation of IκBs results in their proteasomal degradation and the release of NF-κB for nuclear translocation and activation of gene transcription. Here, we review the plethora of structural studies in these NF-κB activation pathways, including the TRAF (TNF receptor-associated factor) proteins, IKK, NF-κB, ubiquitin ligases, and deubiquitinating enzymes. Although these structures only provide snapshots of isolated processes, an emerging picture is that these signaling cascades coalesce into large oligomeric signaling complexes, or signalosomes, for signal propagation.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Polyubiquitination of proteins has a pivotal role in the regulation of numerous cellular functions such as protein degradation, DNA repair and cell signaling. As deregulation of these processes can result in pathological conditions such as inflammatory diseases, neurodegeneration or cancer, tight regulation of the ubiquitin system is of tremendous importance. Ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases can be counteracted by the activity of several deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). CYLD, A20 and OTULIN have been implicated as key DUBs in the negative regulation of NF-κB transcription factor-mediated gene expression upon stimulation of cytokine receptors, antigen receptors and pattern recognition receptors, by removing distinct types of polyubiquitin chains from specific NF-κB signaling proteins. In addition, they control TNF-induced cell death signaling leading to apoptosis and necroptosis via similar mechanisms. In the case of A20, also catalytic-independent mechanisms of action have been demonstrated to have an important role. CYLD, A20 and OTULIN have largely overlapping substrates, suggesting at least partially redundant functions. However, mice deficient in one of the three DUBs show significant phenotypic differences, indicating also non-redundant functions. Here we discuss the activity and polyubiquitin chain-type specificity of CYLD, A20 and OTULIN, their specific role in NF-κB signaling and cell death, the molecular mechanisms that regulate their activity, their role in immune homeostasis and the association of defects in their activity with inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer.\n",

      "TRAFs [tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factors] are a family of signaling molecules that function downstream of multiple receptor signaling pathways and play a pivotal role in the biology of innate, and adaptive immune cells. Following receptor ligation, TRAFs generally function as adapter proteins to mediate the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. With the exception of TRAF1 that lacks a Ring domain, TRAFs have an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity which also contributes to their ability to activate downstream signaling pathways. TRAF-mediated signaling pathways culminate in the activation of several transcription factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; e.g., ERK-1 and ERK-2, JNK, and p38), and interferon-regulatory factors (IRF; e.g., IRF3 and IRF7). The biological role of TRAFs is largely due to their ability to positively or negatively regulate canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling. While TRAF-mediated signaling regulates various immune cell functions, this review is focused on the recent advances in our knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms through which TRAF proteins regulate, positively and negatively, inflammatory signaling pathways, including Toll-IL-1 receptors, RIG-I like receptors, and Nod-like receptors. The review also offers a perspective on the unanswered questions that need to be addressed to fully understand how TRAFs regulate inflammation.\n",

      "The noncanonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway mediates activation of the p52/RelB NF-κB complex and, thereby, regulates specific immunological processes. This NF-κB pathway relies on the inducible processing of NF-κB2 precursor protein, p100, as opposed to the degradation of IκBα in the canonical NF-κB pathway. A central signaling component of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway is NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which functions together with a downstream kinase, IKKα (inhibitor of NF-κB kinase α), to induce phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and processing of p100. Under normal conditions, NIK is targeted for continuous degradation by a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase. In response to signals mediated by a subset of TNF receptor superfamily members, NIK becomes stabilized as a result of TRAF3 degradation, leading to the activation of noncanonical NF-κB. This review discusses both the historical perspectives and the recent progress in the regulation and biological function of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that exerts its functions through the activation of two distinct receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. Both receptors can activate canonical NF-κB and JNK MAP kinase signaling, while TNFR2 can also activate non-canonical NF-κB signaling, leading to numerous changes in gene expression that drive inflammation, cell proliferation and cell survival. On the other hand, TNFR1 also activates signaling pathways leading to cell death by either apoptosis or necroptosis, depending on the cellular context. A key player in TNFR1- and TNFR2-induced signaling is the RING finger protein TRAF2, which is recruited to both receptors upon their stimulation. TRAF2 exerts multiple receptor-specific functions but also mediates cross-talk between TNFR1 and TNFR2, dictating the outcome of TNF stimulation. In this review, we provide an overview of the positive and negative regulatory role of TRAF2 in different TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling pathways. We discuss the underlying molecular mechanism of action, distinguishing between TRAF2 scaffold and E3 ubiquitin ligase functions, and the regulation of TRAF2 by specific post-translational modifications. Finally, we elaborate on some possible strategies to modulate TRAF2 function in the context of therapeutic targeting in autoimmunity and cancer.\n",
